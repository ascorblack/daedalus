// The speaker against a synthesiser that misbehaves in each of the three ways a real one does.
//
// None of these are hypothetical. Every browser's `speechSynthesis` reports an empty voice list on
// the first call and fills it later; Chromium abandons an utterance without firing `onend`; and a
// browser that has not been tapped accepts `speak()` and makes no sound and says nothing about it.
// The page used to wait on that engine's word, so one bad utterance held every sentence behind it —
// the answer was not spoken at all, and the page stayed in "speaking" with the microphone deaf.
//
// What is asserted here is the one property that makes the page recoverable: every sentence handed
// to the speaker is finished with, in bounded time, whatever the engine does.
