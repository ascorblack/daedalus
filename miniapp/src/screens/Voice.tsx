// Voice: the operator talks, a small fast model answers out loud, and the work goes to agents.
//
// The page is a conversation, not a transcript reader. One thing is in the middle of it — an orb that
// breathes when nothing is happening, swells with the operator's own voice while it listens, turns
// and brightens while the concierge thinks, and ripples in time with the answer while it is spoken.
// Under it are the words: what was asked, what is being heard, and the reply a sentence at a time.
// Beside it are the agents the concierge started, each one a tap away from its own session.
//
// The middle of the page is a view, though, and the conversation is not. Reading the transcript of
// what has been said — the concierge's, or any agent's — swaps what is drawn there and touches
// nothing else: the microphone stays open, the answer goes on being read out, the stream is not
// reconnected and not a word of what was being recognised is lost. That is why none of those things
// is in this file any more. They are in `voicesession.ts`, which outlives every view here, and this
// component subscribes to it the way it would to any other store.
//
// The motion is not decoration. There is no other signal on this page: the microphone is open or it
// is not, the model is loaded or it is loading, the answer is being written or being read out, and a
// person who is talking rather than reading has to know which from the corner of their eye. Where the
// reader asked for less of it — `prefers-reduced-motion` — the colours and the words still say all
// four, and the global rule in styles.css takes the animation away.
