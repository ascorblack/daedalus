// An English sentence written straight into a screen cannot be translated, and nothing about the
// page says so: it simply stays English while everything around it turns Russian. This test reads
// the screens as text and fails on one — in a text node, or in a prop a person reads (`title`,
// `placeholder`, `aria-label`, `label`).
//
// What it deliberately does not flag: a single token with no space in it. Brand names (SearXNG,
// DuckDuckGo), tool ids (WebFetch), config fields (base_url), file names and paths are not words to
// translate, and a rule that caught them would be turned off within the week. Everything with two
// words in it is a sentence, and a sentence belongs in `i18n.ts`.
