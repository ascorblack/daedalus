// The voice session: the half of the voice page that must not notice what is on the screen.
//
// A conversation held out loud has four long-lived things in it — a recogniser with the microphone
// open, a speaker with a queue of clips, the concierge's event stream, and the two watchers that
// report the engines finishing their loading — and not one of them has anything to do with what the
// operator is looking at. They used to live in the component that draws the orb, which was fine for
// as long as the orb was the only thing the page ever drew. The moment the middle of the page can
// show a transcript instead, that arrangement tears the conversation down to change a view: the
// answer stops mid-sentence, the recognised words are lost, and the stream reconnects.
//
// So they live here, in one object outside React, acquired by the page and released when the page
// goes away — never when it merely changes its mind about what to draw. The component subscribes to
// the state and reads the level; it owns no part of the session at all.
//
// The counts (`parts()`) are not decoration either. "Switching views does not recreate the speaker"
// is a claim about object lifetimes, which no screenshot can check and no assertion on the DOM can
// either; a counter incremented at each construction can be read from a test and from the page.
