// Package sandbox wraps a terminal's program in bubblewrap: the whole filesystem read-only, the
// folders the host names writable, a private /tmp and process namespace, and the daemon's own run
// and state directories hidden, so a sandboxed shell cannot read the token that commands the daemon.
//
// The sandbox is built here and not by the host, because bubblewrap has to be probed and run where
// the process lives: in the terminals container, on a server, or on the operator's machine.
//
// It is a wall against writing, not against reading. Everything outside the masked directories is
// readable, as it is for the agent's own Exec sandbox, whose flags these follow with two
// differences: no --new-session, which would take the shell's controlling terminal away and with it
// job control (TIOCSTI inside a PTY the daemon owns can only type into that same PTY), and the
// masks.
