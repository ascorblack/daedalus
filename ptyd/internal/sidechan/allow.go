// Package sidechan is what the harness adapters reach besides terminals: running a program for its
// output (exec.run), reading files under allowlisted roots (fs.*), and dialling the sockets and
// loopback ports a launch registered (net.dial).
//
// Each is fenced by a list. The token that opens the daemon can already start a terminal with any
// argv, so the exec list guards against mistakes rather than against a hostile host; the file roots
// and the deny list are a real wall, because they are what keeps the CLIs' credentials out of every
// read the host makes on an agent's behalf.

// DefaultExecAllow are the programs exec.run may run, by the basename of what PATH resolves: the
