"""The main orchestrator's tools: see the projects, hand them work, follow it, cancel it, create a
project, pass on an answer the operator gave in words, and read its own files.

They are not ``TOOLS`` of this package: three of them share a name with another role's tool (the
voice concierge's ``Delegate`` and ``Projects``, the project orchestrator's ``Answer``), so they are
registered in the main orchestrator's own registry (:func:`build`), which no other session is shown.
Each goes through the dispatcher extension, which first checks that the calling session still holds
the office.
