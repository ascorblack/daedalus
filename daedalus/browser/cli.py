"""The browser for command-line staff: the same tools, reached through ``ptyd tools-mcp --set browser``.

A command-line member (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, pi, Grok) has no session of this host, so its
browser calls arrive as held posts on its launch's hook listener, and are answered here with the
same ``BrowserAgent`` a Daedalus session's native tools use. What differs is the caller: the owner is
the staff member; where the browser may go is judged by the host's policy before the call, as it is
for a session; a sensitive action is a question held for the operator (never the orchestrator) on the
member's own request list; and files are read and delivered through the team's file handoff, so a
member on the operator's machine gets a download in its inbox like any file handed to it.
