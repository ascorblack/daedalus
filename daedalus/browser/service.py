"""The browser service: every environment's browser daemon behind one interface, mirrored in the database.

The daemon owns Chromium, its profiles and tabs; this service owns what the host knows about them —
whose group is whose, which project's cookies it uses, who holds its controls, how it ended — and
keeps that true across its own restarts, which the daemons outlive. On every connection it
reconciles: a group the daemon no longer lists closed while nobody was looking, or went with a daemon
that restarted (``lost``); one the daemon runs with no row is adopted from the labels it was opened
with. Between reconciles it follows the daemon's events.

It is also where a person's hand on the browser meets the agent: taking and giving back control, an
agent's handoff, the "needs you" a page raises, and the one wake the owner gets when the browser is
given back.
