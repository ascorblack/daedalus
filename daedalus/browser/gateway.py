"""The app's way to a browser's live view: which frames the socket carries, and the view's audit.

The tickets, the Origin rule and the relay are shared with the terminals (``daedalus.gateway``). What
is the browser's own is the frame check — from the app only ATTACH, VIEW, ACK and a person's INPUT, at
their sizes (``docs/architecture/browser.md``, The host's relay) — and the audit, which records who
watched and how many inputs of each kind a person sent, never what they typed.
