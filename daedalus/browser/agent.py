"""The browser as an agent uses it: the tools' operations, whoever calls them.

A Daedalus session calls them as native tools (``daedalus.tools.browser``); a command-line staff
member calls the same names through its launch's MCP entry, which the host answers from a hook post.
Both come here with a ``Caller`` — who is asking, how a sensitive action is asked about for them, and
where their files are — so the policy, the credential wall, the untrusted framing and the audit are
one code path, not two copies that drift.

What comes back is text for a model. Everything a page says is fenced as data from the web: the
agent is told, in the result itself, that the page cannot speak for the operator.
