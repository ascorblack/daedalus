"""The host bridge: the operator's machine as a Docker installation reaches it.

In Docker the agent's container sees nothing of the host but the one directory the host's terminal
daemon keeps its socket in. So everything that has to happen on the host — a folder of a project
checked or made, git run in a staff worktree there — goes through that daemon's side channels, and
only while it answers. This module is the one place the rest of the application asks: whether the
bridge is up, run git there, check a folder there. Natively the host is this process's own
environment and none of it is needed.
