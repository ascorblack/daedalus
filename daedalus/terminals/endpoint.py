"""Where a terminal daemon is: its run directory, and what the directory says.

The host is told only the directory. The daemon writes two files into it — ``endpoint``, a unix
socket name relative to the directory or a loopback TCP port, and ``token``, new at every start —
and the endpoint only once it accepts connections, so an endpoint that exists leads to a ready daemon.
A relative socket name keeps a directory bind-mounted at another path meaning the same thing on both
sides of the mount.
