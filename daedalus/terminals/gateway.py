"""The app's way to a terminal: which frames a terminal's socket carries, and its tickets and audit.

The tickets, the Origin rule and the relay are shared with the browser's live view
(``daedalus.gateway``); what is a terminal's own is the frame check below — the browser frames of
``docs/architecture/terminals.md`` — and the audit of a host terminal's attachments.

Nothing here imports the web framework (only the API extension may); the routes hand this module a
``FrameSocket`` and it does the rest.
