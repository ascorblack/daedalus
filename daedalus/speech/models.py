"""Getting a chosen model onto the disk, and off it again.

A model is half a gigabyte over a link that may not survive it, so a download here is resumable: the
archive lands in a part file, an interrupted one is continued with a range request rather than begun
again, and the operator can stop one mid-flight. What arrives is checked before it is believed — the
published size always, the sha256 for all but the two archives that have none, the pinned file list
for those two, and in every case the unpacked directory against what its kind actually needs to load.
Only then does it become installed; a download that fails any of those leaves nothing behind but a
line in the log.

Progress is a stream of events rather than a number to poll, because the Mini App shows a bar and the
bar should move. :meth:`Downloads.watch` hands out a queue that the API turns into SSE.

Nothing here imports the engine's wheel: downloading a model must work on an installation that has not
installed the extra yet, since that is exactly the installation that is about to.

Two catalogs use this, and it belongs to neither. Recognition models and synthesis voices are fetched,
resumed, verified, unpacked and deleted identically — the only differences are which catalog an id is
looked up in and which loader is asked whether the unpacked directory makes sense — so both are
constructor arguments and the rest of the file never asks which kind it is holding. The two live in
separate trees (``models/stt/`` and ``models/tts/``), so an id that exists in both catalogs would still
be two directories and two manifests.
