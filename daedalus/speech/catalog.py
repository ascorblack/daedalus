"""The list of speech models the operator can choose from, and what is known about each.

Every entry is one archive from the sherpa-onnx model zoo — a GitHub release of the engine's own
project, so the download host is the same people who wrote the runtime. An archive unpacks into a
directory of ONNX files whose names differ from family to family; the catalog deliberately does not
record those names. It records the *kind* of model, and :mod:`daedalus.speech.engine` finds the files
inside the unpacked directory by their shape. A zoo that renames ``encoder.onnx`` to
``encoder.int8.onnx`` in a later build then costs nothing, where a hard-coded file list would have
turned into a model that downloads and refuses to load.

``sha256`` is the archive's digest. Most of it comes from GitHub, which reports a ``digest`` for every
release asset uploaded since mid-2025 and which covers all but two of the entries below; the rest was
hashed here, and where both exist they agree. Two archives predate the field and have none — see
``contents``, which pins their file list so that size alone is not the whole of the check — and
``SpeechModel.verified`` says which is which, so the picker can tell the operator plainly rather than
implying every download is checksummed. Sizes are the compressed archive; ``unpacked_bytes`` is what
the disk actually gives up, and ``memory_mb`` is roughly what the loaded model costs in RAM.

Scores are the same two 0-100 bars the operator sees: ``accuracy`` is how well it is expected to hear,
``speed`` how much faster than real time it runs on an ordinary CPU. They are editorial — read them as
"this one is quicker than that one", not as a measurement.
