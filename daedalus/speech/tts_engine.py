"""Loading a downloaded voice and turning words into audio.

Everything in here is CPU-bound and blocking, and none of it may run on the event loop: a voice takes
a second or two to load and a paragraph takes about as long again to speak. The public surface is
therefore async and every call crosses into a worker thread, while the loaded voice is cached —
loading Piper for each sentence would cost more than synthesising it.

Two ways out, because there are two things the answer is wanted for. :meth:`TtsEngine.speak` renders
a whole piece of text and hands back samples. :meth:`TtsEngine.stream` renders it a sentence at a
time and yields each as it is finished, so the first words are audible while the rest is still being
made; on a voice that runs four times faster than speech that is the difference between waiting for
one sentence and waiting for a paragraph.

**Phonemisation ships with the model.** Every Piper archive in the catalog carries its own copy of
``espeak-ng-data`` — about nineteen megabytes of it — and Kokoro and KittenTTS carry the same. So a
Russian voice expands "17" to "семнадцатое" and reads a Latin word inside a Russian sentence in
Russian phonemes with nothing installed in the image and no Python fallback anywhere. The one voice
here that does not work that way, Mandarin, ships a lexicon and three rule FSTs instead, and
:func:`resolve` tells the two apart by what is in the directory rather than by anything in the
catalog — the same rule the recognition side follows for the same reason.

One family does none of that. Supertonic carries no phonemiser at all — it indexes unicode straight
into its text encoder — which is how a hundred and forty megabytes reads thirty-one languages and
expands "17" into words in each of them. It is also the one family that can be *told* where the stress
falls, so a Russian answer going to it goes through :mod:`daedalus.speech.ru_stress` first; see
:data:`OUTPUT_GAIN` for the other thing that family needs, which is to be played louder.

Files are found by shape, not by name (see :mod:`daedalus.speech.tts_catalog`) — except Supertonic's,
which are found by name because it has four of them. :func:`resolve` is the whole of that knowledge,
and it is deliberately small.

    The same four words the recognition side uses for its models, and deliberately so: ``idle`` is
    nothing chosen or nothing loaded yet, ``loading`` is the synthesiser being built, ``ready`` is a
    voice that will speak the next sentence immediately, and ``error`` is a load that failed with the
    reason. The page needs the difference because the first answer after a restart waits seconds on a
    cold voice and none at all on a warm one, and an answer written on the screen and not spoken for
    fifteen seconds is indistinguishable from one that will never be spoken.

    Loading is slow and happens under a lock, so two sentences arriving together load once and both
    wait. Choosing another voice drops the old one; there is never more than one resident.

    Nothing here unloads a voice that has gone quiet. A Piper voice costs about thirty-five megabytes
    of memory and a second and a half to build, and the operator who is going to say something else
    is the operator who just said something: paying that load again to save the memory between two
    utterances is the trade nobody wants. The voice is let go when it is replaced, deleted or
    deselected, and at no other time.

    Because loading is slow it is also *watchable*: :meth:`warm` starts it with no sentence behind it,
    and every state it passes through is published to :meth:`watch`, so the page can say "loading the
    voice" with something moving rather than leaving the operator looking at an answer nobody reads.
