"""The local voice as the rest of the application sees it.

One object on the application, holding the voices directory and the loaded synthesiser, with the
questions anyone asks it: is a voice of ours in use, read this aloud, and what should the page be
told. Everything that decides *whether* to speak here decides it in :meth:`LocalTts.available`, so the
precedence — a downloaded voice, then the configured endpoint, then the browser's own synthesiser — is
written once and is the same wherever speech comes out.

The audio leaves as a sequence of clips rather than as one file: :meth:`LocalTts.clips` drives
:meth:`TtsEngine.stream`, so each sentence is encoded and sent the moment it is synthesised and the
page can start playing the first one while the rest is still being made. On a voice that runs four
times faster than speech that is the difference between a pause of half a second and a pause of six.
It is also where cancellation lives: the generator stops at a sentence boundary when the client
disconnects or when the operator talks over the answer, so nothing keeps the synthesiser busy for a
request nobody is listening to any more.

Ogg Opus where ``opusenc`` is present — it is, in the runtime image, for the recognition side's sake —
and WAV otherwise. A sentence is about two hundred kilobytes as WAV and twenty as Opus, which matters
on a phone and not at all on a desktop, so the encoder is used when it is there and never required.
