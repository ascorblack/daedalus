"""Which modules of the host are reachable from its entry points.

A change to the agent's own code is only a change if the running agent executes it. This module
answers, from the source tree alone, whether a module is on any execution path: it parses every
``import`` in the ``daedalus`` package and walks the graph from the entry points the process
actually starts from. Tests are not importers: a module that only its tests import is dead.

The walk is static (``ast``), so it works on a worktree that is not importable in this process,
and it is deliberately generous: a dynamic import by string (``importlib.import_module(name)``)
counts when the string is a literal and the module it names is resolvable from the source — an
absolute name, or a relative one resolved against the package the source names: a literal
``package=`` (keyword or positional), the file's own ``__package__``, or its bare ``__name__``. When
the call names no package at all the literal is kept as written: ``importlib.import_module(".x")``
raises ``TypeError``, so the call has no module to point at and substituting the caller's own package
asserted an edge the interpreter cannot follow. When the package is an expression
the source does not name — a variable, another module's attribute — the literal is kept and no edge
is drawn: a module reached only that way needs a path the walk can see. A relative name that would
leave the package root keeps its literal form too, since there is no module it could name.
Package-level discovery is named in ``DISCOVERED_PACKAGES``: for those packages, every direct
submodule that a loader actually imports counts — the modules ``discover_tools`` loads by name, and
an underscore-prefixed module is loaded explicitly by its importer or not at all, so it is not counted
as discovered. A relative ``from`` import resolves against the file's package. Generosity is the
right error: the gate exists to catch modules nothing mentions, not to argue about how they are
mentioned.
What generosity does not cover is a call the interpreter refuses or a branch it never enters: a
keyword shape Python rejects, an arity it rejects, a receiver that is not the import system, and the
bodies of ``if TYPE_CHECKING:``, ``if False:``, ``if 1 == 2:`` or ``while False:`` draw no edge,
because nothing is loadable from them.
