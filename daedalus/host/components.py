"""The optional pieces of an installation: what each one unlocks, whether it is here, and how it arrives.

A portable build is small because most of what an agent *can* do, most installations never ask it to
do. The headless browser is a third of a container image; Node is another quarter; the speech engine
is fifteen megabytes of wheels that an installation which never says a word out loud should not
carry. Leaving them out is right. Leaving them out silently is not — the owner opened Settings →
Voice on a portable build and found two sentences about the browser's own synthesiser where the model
pickers should have been, with nothing on the page saying that a download would put them there.

So this module is the one list. Every optional piece, what it costs, what it turns on, how to see
whether it is present, and — the part that was missing — how to get it from inside the app, which is
a different answer in each of the two installation shapes:

============  =======================================  =========================================
component     native (a process on the machine)        Docker (a container from an image)
============  =======================================  =========================================
speech        a Python extra, synced into the           in the image already
              installation's own environment
browser       the launcher fetches it into the          the ``:browser`` image tag carries it;
              installation's runtime folder             switching tags is the launcher's job
node          the launcher fetches it, likewise         no image carries it
git, rg,      the machine's own, or the pinned copy     in the image already
opus-tools    in the runtime folder
bwrap         Linux only; the machine's package         in the image already
speech models downloaded from the pickers               the same, and to the same place
============  =======================================  =========================================

Two rules the shape of this file follows from:

**A status is measured, never assumed.** ``installed`` means something was found — an import, a
binary, a directory — not that the mode it is running in usually has it. The container that was built
without the speech extra reads ``missing`` here, and says so, rather than being told what its image
normally holds.

**Nothing claims to be installable that is not.** ``installable`` is false wherever this process
cannot actually do it, and then ``fix`` carries the command that can, or the tag to run. A button
that produces an error is worse than a sentence that produces a command.
