"""Moving files to where a staff member can open them, and taking theirs back.

Orchestrators pass files by handle (``daedalus.stores.files``). This module is where a handle becomes
bytes on the member's side and where a member's path becomes a handle again, and it is the only
place that knows which environment is which:

- a member of this process's own environment — a Daedalus member in the agent's container, a
  command-line member in the container's terminal service, anything natively — gets a direct copy;
- a command-line member on the host, seen from the container, gets the file through the host
  terminal daemon's ``fs.write``, which writes nowhere but an inbox under a project folder.

Either way the file lands in ``<the member's working folder>/.agents/inbox/<task>/<name>``, and only
once it is there is the member told that path: a brief never names a file the member cannot open.
The inbox carries a ``.gitignore`` of ``*``, so a repository whose exclude file the host cannot
write (one on the host) does not show it; ``.agents/`` itself may hold the operator's own files and
is left alone.
