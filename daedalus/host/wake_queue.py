"""Waking a sleeping agent with batches of bus events: what an orchestrator is woken by.

An agent that runs a team sleeps between turns. The bus tells it what happened, but a turn per event
would be a turn per keystroke of its team, so events are gathered: routine ones wait for a window
after the first of them, the ones that cannot wait go at once, and events about the same thing
replace each other (the latest status of a member, the latest move of a task). Each delivered batch
is one message, and the cursor of the last delivered event is stored, so a restart delivers what was
missed once and nothing twice.

The queue knows nothing of projects or staff. Its owner gives it a filter, a ``classify`` that says
which events are worth waking for and which cannot wait, a ``render`` that turns a batch into text,
and a ``deliver`` that hands the text over. The same class serves any agent woken that way.

Time is injected (``clock``) and the driving loop only sleeps until the next thing is due, so a test
steps it with :meth:`WakeQueue.pump` and a fake clock instead of waiting for real seconds.
