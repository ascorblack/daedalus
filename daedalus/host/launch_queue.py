"""When a staff member's assignment may start, and when it has to wait — with the reason in words.

Two limits bound how much runs at once. A project runs at most its ``concurrency`` of staff sessions
that are working (starting, working, waiting on a question or a permission, or silent). The machine
runs at most ``running_cap`` terminal sessions across every project and both environments; a
command-line staff member is a terminal session, so its launch waits for a place there as well, while
a Daedalus staff member is not a terminal and is held to its project's limit only. Launches of one
project are spaced ``stagger`` seconds apart, so a queue that frees six slots at once does not start
six processes in the same second.

The queue is in memory. What it holds is not lost with it: an assignment is the task's assignee on the
board, and the host offers every assigned task that has not started to the queue again at start. A
waiting entry always carries why it waits, because "queued" with no reason is the question the
operator then has to ask.
