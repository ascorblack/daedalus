"""Retention for the workspace checkpoint stores.

A snapshot is taken before every operator turn and after every run, and nothing ever removed
one: a store grew for as long as the session did, and the stores together for as long as the
installation. Retention gives them two bounds — an age and a total size — and one promise that
overrides both: the newest ``ops.checkpoint_keep_last`` snapshots of a session are always there,
so the undo the operator actually reaches for cannot be taken away by a store somebody else filled.

The snapshots of one workspace are a single chain of commits, so an old one is not dropped by
deleting a ref: :meth:`daedalus.host.checkpoints.Checkpoints.truncate` cuts the chain at the
oldest snapshot that stays and lets ``git gc`` remove what is then unreachable. That is also why
the unit of work here is the *store* and not the session — a subagent shares its leader's
workspace, and both sessions' snapshots are commits in the same chain.
