"""Tool policy: what a call may do, decided from its arguments before it runs.

The container is the agent's; the operator's machine, secrets, repositories and the outside world
are not. Governance says so in prose; this module says it in rules the dispatcher enforces on every
call. A rule looks at the tool and its arguments (a shell command is parsed into its simple commands
first, so ``cd x && rm -rf /`` is seen as ``rm -rf /``) and answers allow, deny or ask.

*deny* is final. *ask* is a denial the operator can lift: the answer carries an approval key, the
operator grants it (``/allow <key>`` in chat, the Mini App, or the API), and the same call passes
once. The built-in rules live here, in the repository, so they change only through a reviewed pull
request; the operator's rules in ``config.toml`` can add denials and questions but can never allow
what a built-in rule denies.
