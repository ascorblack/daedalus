"""What this installation is actually able to do, decided once at startup.

Self-development is not a property of the code but of the installation around it: a server with a
GitHub token and a rebuild channel can open pull requests against its own repositories and replace
itself; a desktop install has a checkout and nothing else; an install with neither should not carry
tools, routes, prompt text or a navigation entry for any of it.

``selfdev.mode`` names which of the three it is. The operator sets it in the configuration
(``[self_change] mode = "off" | "local" | "server"``); ``auto``, the default, is resolved here from
the prerequisites that are really present. The resolution is pure — the same settings and
configuration always give the same answer — so the doctor can recompute it without a running
session manager.

The mode is fixed for the life of the process: tools are registered, routes are mounted and the
prompt is assembled from it at startup. Changing it in the configuration takes effect on a restart.
