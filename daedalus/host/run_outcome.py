"""What a run that ended without an answer says about itself, and where it says it.

A loop iteration died on a compaction that could not make progress, and all the chat showed was
"Worked for 27m · 176 steps", a file it had written, and the host's "Context summary" card below
it. Nothing said the run had failed, why, or that no answer had come of it; the next iteration
started as if nothing had happened. A run that ends without an answer now leaves one closing line
in the transcript — why it stopped, which step or tier gave out, and that there is no answer — and a
loop's next iteration is told the same thing before its instruction.

The line is a transcript row only. It is not in the working history the model reads, so it costs no
context and cannot be mistaken for an answer; the loop note is the one place the model hears of it.
