"""Asking the launcher to do the one thing only it can do.

Two pieces of a native installation are not Python packages and not files the app can put in place
for itself: Node, which lands in the installation's own runtime folder, and the headless browser,
which Playwright unpacks where the launcher told it to. Both are fetched by the launcher, because
the launcher owns that folder and decides what goes into it — the app is a process it started.

The launcher already has a loopback page with an action endpoint, so this does not invent a channel;
it uses that one. The handshake is the file the launcher writes when it takes ownership of the
installation, ``<data>/launcher.json``, mode 0600 and owned by the same account this process runs
as. It carries the port the page listens on and the token every action has to bear.

**What the token is and what it is not.** It authorises start, stop, update, apply and the runtime
extras — everything the launcher's own buttons do. It is not a credential of the operator's and it
never leaves the machine: the file is read here, the header is set on one request to 127.0.0.1, and
neither the value nor anything derived from it is logged, returned to a caller or put in an error.
An error from here names the port and the action, never the token.

**Why the launcher accepts this request at all.** Its rules refuse anything that changes state and
did not come from its own page: a ``Sec-Fetch-Site`` that is cross-site, an ``Origin`` that is not
the page's, a ``Host`` that is not the loopback address it is listening on, or a missing token. A
request from this module carries no ``Sec-Fetch-Site`` and no ``Origin`` — a browser writes those,
a client does not — aims at ``127.0.0.1:<port>``, and carries the token. So it passes without the
rules being loosened: what a hostile page still cannot do is read a 0600 file to learn the token,
and it could not set the custom header cross-site even if it had one.

**What keeps the agent away from this file, and what does not.** ``Settings.sealed_paths`` names it,
so the file tools refuse it and a shell command that spells the path out is refused with them. That
is hygiene, not containment, and it is worth saying plainly: the sealed set is matched against the
words of a command, so a path the command builds for itself — from ``Path.home()``, from ``$HOME``,
inside a Python one-liner — is not matched, and the loopback port the launcher listens on is not
restricted by the egress rules either. What the file is really protected by is its mode: 0600 and
owned by the account this process runs as. The agent asks the app for an install the way the
operator does, and the app is what holds the launcher's keys.
