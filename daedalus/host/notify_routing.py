"""Where one notification goes, decided once, by a function that does no I/O.

Everything the decision depends on arrives as a value: the notification (a :class:`Candidate`),
the operator's preferences, what the operator is looking at (a presence snapshot), what Telegram
can do for it (:class:`TelegramFacts`) and the time. That makes the matrix, the levels, quiet hours,
mutes, presence and the Telegram rules one table of tests rather than a behaviour only a running
host shows. Each channel's reason lands in the notification's ``delivered``, which is how "why did
my phone not buzz" gets an answer.

The rules, in the order they apply:

1. ``force`` (the test button) reaches every channel that exists, whatever else holds.
2. The operator is looking at the thing: an answer is not recorded at all, anything else is
   recorded as seen, and a request waiting for them is a toast (the dock beside it shows it).
3. A quiet notification is a record, nothing more.
4. The matrix: a channel whose cell is off stays off; an ``urgent`` cell only carries urgent ones.
   The app's cell off means the entry is recorded as seen.
5. A muted project says nothing below urgent.
6. A window in front of the operator makes push and the desktop redundant.
7. Quiet hours hold back push, the desktop and Telegram below urgent.
8. Telegram: what the front or the producer already delivered is ``handled``; with no bot there is
   no Telegram at all; an orchestrated project's items are its orchestrator's to post, and the
   router never posts into a project's topic; a session detached from Telegram (a site session)
   stays off it at every level; a session otherwise gets its topic, and a notice with no session and
   no project goes to General.
9. What went to Telegram is not pushed or raised on the desktop as well.
10. A repeat of an entry the operator has not seen yet makes no second sound unless its level rose.
11. A staff member's request in an orchestrated project is held for the orchestrator first.
12. Rate limits: per session, and one ceiling for everything.
