"""Staff worktrees: one git worktree per staff member per project folder, inside that folder.

A staff member who works in a git folder gets ``<folder>/.agents/worktrees/<staff-slug>`` and a branch
``agent/<staff-slug>/<task-id>-<title-slug>`` cut from the folder's current branch. The worktree lives
inside the project folder rather than in a volume of its own so that the session's walls, the terminal
daemon's allowed roots and a CLI running on the host all name it by the same path, and so that it works
the same in the host environment, which has no such volume. It is reused from task to task — the
dependencies a staff member installed there stay installed — and only switched to the next task's branch
when it is clean.

Git is driven in the operator's own repository, so the rules are conservative:

- nothing is forced: a dirty worktree is refused rather than reset, a branch is deleted with ``-d`` only
  once it is merged, a merge that conflicts is aborted and the folder left as it was;
- the operator's identity is never touched: the staff identity lives in the worktree's own config;
- ``.agents/`` goes into ``info/exclude``, never into the repository's ``.gitignore``;
- operations that change the repository's shared worktree and ref state run one at a time per
  repository, keyed by its common git directory, so two staff members hired into one repository at the
  same moment do not race ``git worktree add`` against each other.

A folder of this process's own environment is driven with local git. A folder of the other environment
(a host folder while Daedalus runs in a container) is driven through the host terminal bridge's
``exec_run``; without the bridge it is refused with the reason, and the staff member stays unassigned
rather than silently working in the shared folder.
