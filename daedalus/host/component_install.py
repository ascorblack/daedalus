"""Putting a missing component in place, one at a time, with the work visible while it happens.

Three things an installer of this kind has to get right, and each of them is a decision in the code
below rather than a detail.

**One at a time.** Two ``uv sync`` runs into the same environment at once is how a site-packages
directory ends up half written, and two launcher actions at once is refused by the launcher anyway.
So a second request while one is running is a 409 naming what is running, not a queue.

**The work is somewhere else.** A Python extra is a subprocess of this process, and its output is
lines this module can forward. Node and the headless browser are the launcher's: it was asked over
the loopback bridge, it answered "started", and what it does next is visible only as its own status.
So progress here is honest about which of the two it is — a line of output while there are lines, and
otherwise the plain fact that the launcher is working on it.

**A finished install is not always a working component.** The speech engine is imported on demand and
appears at once; Node and the browser are found through the environment the supervisor started with,
so the process has to be restarted before it can see them. That is carried on every frame as
``restart_required`` rather than discovered by an operator whose new browser does not work.
