"""What the operator is looking at, as the app's windows report it.

Every window of the app says, every twenty seconds while it is visible and whenever that changes,
whether it is visible and focused and which sessions, terminals and projects it shows. From those
reports the host answers three questions without asking anybody:

- *attending X*: some window is visible, focused, has reported recently, and shows X;
- *present*: some window is visible and focused;
- *away*: neither.

It is decided here rather than in a window because push and desktop notifications are sent by the
host, which needs the answer at the moment it decides whether to send one.

A report lives ``ttl_seconds``. A window that also holds ``/api/events`` is tied to that connection:
when the connection drops, the window counts for ``grace_seconds`` more (a reconnect inside that
keeps it) and is then forgotten, which is far sooner than the report would expire on its own — a
phone that is locked stops talking without saying goodbye. A connection with ``kind=launcher`` is
the desktop launcher listening for notifications to raise; it is a deliverer, never a presence.

Every change is published on the bus as the ephemeral ``presence`` event, never stored and never
streamed, with the ids that became attended, so an in-process subscriber (the unread-result mark,
the notification router) can act on "the operator just opened this".
