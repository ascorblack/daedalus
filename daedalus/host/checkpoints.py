"""Git-backed workspace checkpoints.

Every session workspace keeps a hidden repository (``.checkpoints``) whose work tree is
the workspace itself. A snapshot is taken before every operator turn and after every run,
so "undo the last three turns" can put the files back as well as the history. The
repository is derived data: deleting ``.checkpoints`` loses nothing but the undo.
