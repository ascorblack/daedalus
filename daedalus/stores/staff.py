"""Staff: the named members of a project's team, the sessions they work in, what is said to them,
and the requests they leave waiting.

A staff member is an identity that outlives its sessions: a name, what it is responsible for, which
executor runs it (Daedalus itself or one of the command-line agents), and notes it carries from one
task to the next. A session is one run of work for one task. The database, not a lock, keeps the
rule that a staff member has at most one live session — a partial unique index — so two launches
racing for the same member lose in the one place every process sees.

Every pending decision of a project is a row in ``asks``. Answering is a compare-and-set on that
row: whoever updates it delivers the answer, and every other answer — the app, Telegram, a push
action, the orchestrator — learns who was first.
