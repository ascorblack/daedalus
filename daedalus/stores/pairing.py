"""Pairing links: the way into the app on an installation that has no Telegram to vouch for a browser.

The server mints one code at a start that finds no other way in (no bot, no passkey) and writes the
link it belongs to next to the database (``<state_dir>/pairing-url``, readable by the operator only);
the log names the file, never the link. Opening that link once turns the browser into a signed-in one;
from there the operator adds a passkey and never needs the link again. ``daedalus auth pair`` makes
another at any time.

A code is stored as its SHA-256 only: whoever reads the database reads no usable link. It lives for
half an hour, is spent the first time it is opened, and spending one revokes every other code that is
still outstanding — a link that did its job leaves no second copy working in a log or a paste buffer.
