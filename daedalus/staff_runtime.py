"""The seam between a project's team and whatever runs each member.

A staff member is run by Daedalus itself or by one of the command-line agents. Everything above
this seam — assignment, the launch queue, requests, statuses, the orchestrator's tools and the app —
is one code path; below it, one :class:`StaffRuntime` per executor starts a session, delivers what
is said to it and reports back. A runtime never writes the staff tables itself: every change of state
goes through :class:`TeamIngress`, which writes the row and publishes the event together, so a
status on the screen and a status in the database cannot disagree.

The value types are frozen and carry everything a runtime needs, composed by the host: a runtime
does not look anything up. :class:`FakeStaffRuntime` stands in for a real one in tests.
