"""The staff view's routes: one member's live session as its runtime sees it, the operator's message
from its composer, its transcript, its events and its changes. (The messages with their receipts are
``GET /api/staff/{id}/messages`` in ``api.py``.)

The team's own routes (assign, tell, interrupt, pause, release, the requests) are in ``api.py``;
these are what the staff view reads, and they ask the member's runtime rather than the rows alone,
because a command-line member's transcript and channels live in its CLI and its terminal daemon.
Like ``api.py`` this module may import the HTTP framework; the runtimes behind it may not.
