"""The main orchestrator creates a project: confirmed first, then made, then set up by its orchestrator.

``CreateProject`` never makes anything by itself. It checks the folders it was given — a container
folder must lie under the roots allowed for new projects, a host folder is looked at on the host
through its terminal daemon — and puts a confirmation card to the operator: the name, the folders and
where they live. The card is a request row like any other (first answer wins); a misheard voice
command therefore never becomes a folder on the operator's machine. Only the operator's "Create"
makes the project, switches its orchestrator on and opens dispatch #1, the survey that writes the
brief; while it runs the project is "being set up", and every question the project asks is shown in
the main chat as well.

A confirmation for a project on the host is answered in the app alone: no Telegram button and no
notification action offers it.
