"""The extensions a start may not do without, and why.

Everything else is isolated: an extension that raises while installing is logged, reported to
the operator and skipped, and the rest of the chain still installs. The reason is what a
failure costs on each side. A bot that refuses to start says nothing to anyone — no chat, no
Mini App, no notifications — and under a supervisor it says nothing repeatedly, so the one channel the
operator has for finding out what is wrong is the channel the failure closed. A bot that starts
without its board or its scheduler is diminished and says so, and the operator can decide.

``notifications`` is the exception, and it is fatal deliberately: it is the channel every other
failure is reported through. Starting without it would produce exactly the silent degradation
the isolation exists to avoid — a bot running with subsystems missing and no way to say which.
It is installed first for the same reason, so the failures below it have somewhere to go.

An extension that fails partway may already have registered hooks; those stay registered. The
alternative — unwinding a half-installed extension — needs an uninstall path per extension that
nothing else would ever call, and a hook whose subsystem is missing fails at its own call site,
where it is one tool's error rather than the whole start.
