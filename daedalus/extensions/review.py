"""Review and merge: the operator reads a staff branch on its card and merges it with one button.

The orchestrator proposes, the operator merges. A staff member's ``Report(done)`` puts the task in
review with ``merge_state='proposed'``; this module is the only way that work reaches the folder:

- :meth:`Review.review` reads what a merge would bring — commits, the files and their line counts, a
  bounded patch, the dry run of the merge — and what stands in its way, without changing anything;
- :meth:`Review.merge` merges the branch into the folder's current branch as a merge commit when the
  folder is clean, still on the branch the task was cut from, and the dry run is clean; the task is
  done, the worktree goes when the member has nothing else to do in that folder, the merged branch is
  deleted with ``-d`` and ``task.accepted`` tells the orchestrator. A merge that fails is undone, the
  folder is exactly as it was, and ``task.merge_failed`` wakes the orchestrator to sort it out;
- :meth:`Review.reject` sends the task back to its member with the operator's note.

Nothing is pushed: the operator's remote is the operator's business.
