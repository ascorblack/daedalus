"""What the orchestrator's team tools do: hire, change and dismiss staff, hand them work, talk to them,
read what they did, answer what they ask, and stop or pause them.

The limits live below this module, in the staff store and in :class:`daedalus.extensions.staff.Team`,
so the operator's routes and these tools refuse the same things: a grant without a quoted allowance, a
dismissal of someone still working, a task with half a brief. What this module adds is what only an
orchestrator needs — names resolved from what a model typed, the harness catalog checked before a hire,
and refusals worded so the orchestrator knows its next move.

Every operation receives the project the calling session is the current orchestrator of; the
dispatcher in :mod:`daedalus.extensions.orchestrator_ops` checked that first.
