"""Task board: the plan lives outside the model's context.

A summary degrades; a board does not. Tasks carry acceptance criteria, a checklist,
dependencies (a task becomes ready when every dependency is done), a priority and the
session working on it. Work-in-progress is limited, a task whose session went quiet is
handed back, and the board is the same object in the Mini App, in ``/board`` and in the
agent's tools.

Every agent sees its own board: the tasks created by its session and its subagents, plus
the tasks the operator posted to nobody in particular. Another agent's tasks are not on it.
Two independent agents each keep a plan there, and a loop agent that "reads the board at the
start of a long task" reads its plan, not a colleague's — the day it did, it picked up a bug
fix a second agent was already working on. Work crosses the line by a hand-over (SubAgent,
SpawnAgent, AskPeer) or by the operator, never by one agent finding it on the other's board.

A project has a board of its own as well: every task whose ``project_id`` is the project. Its staff
and its orchestrator see that board rather than a family's, a task there can be assigned to a staff
member and carries a four-part brief, and "Needs you" is read from the project's open requests to
the operator rather than stored. What the operator posts to a project's board stays off the
ordinary agents' boards: "unaddressed" means unaddressed and outside every project, or a single
agent working in the project would find the team's work on its own board.
