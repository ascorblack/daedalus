"""The operator's list of what waits for them, and the answers they send from it together.

A project's orchestrator asks in batches, and its staff's permissions and escalated questions wait
for the operator beside them. The app shows them as one list in the right panel — a project's own in
its focus mode, every orchestrated project's in the main chat — where the operator answers some,
leaves others, and presses Send once.

Each answer follows the rule every window follows: the first answer to update the request's row
wins (:meth:`daedalus.extensions.staff.Team.answer`), and one that lost says who was first. What
this module adds is the batch. The answers that won are marked with the batch's id on their
resolution, so their own ``ask.answered`` events do not wake the orchestrator one by one, and one
``ask.batch`` event per project then wakes it once with all of them. An orchestrator woken for
every answer of a list of eight would spend eight turns on what one turn reads better.
