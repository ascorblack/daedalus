"""Notifications: the one place anything that wants the operator's attention is recorded and routed.

A scheduled run that failed, a question an agent asks, a policy refusal waiting for an approval, a
service that did not come back: each producer posts a :class:`Draft`, and the service does three
things with it, in this order:

1. decides where it goes — the app (a toast), a push, the desktop, a Telegram line — with the pure
   :func:`daedalus.host.notify_routing.decide`, from the operator's preferences, the level, quiet
   hours, mutes and what the operator is looking at;
2. records it as a row of ``notifications`` (or merges it into the open row with the same dedupe
   key), with the reason for each channel in ``delivered``;
3. delivers it and announces it on the bus as ``notify``, which the app and the desktop launcher read.

The router (:class:`NotificationRouter`) turns the bus's own events — a run that finished, a question,
a permission request, a staff member's turn — into drafts, and resolves a notification when its
request is answered anywhere. A request can be answered from the notification itself through
:meth:`NotificationService.act`: the first answer wins, the second is told what the first one was.

An agent reaches the operator itself through the ``Notify`` tool, which posts through the same
service (:class:`AgentNotifier`) under a budget of its own; subagents and staff do not have it.

What the router never does: post into a project's Telegram topic (the orchestrator speaks there), put
a detached session on Telegram at any level, or do anything Telegram-related when no bot is bound.
