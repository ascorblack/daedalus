"""A project's orchestrator: its session, its office, what it sees and what wakes it.

``app.extensions["orchestrator"]`` switches a project's orchestrator on and off and replaces it,
answers "is this session the project's current orchestrator" for every one of its tools, writes the
project's state into the turn context of each of its turns, and wakes it with batches of the
project's events (:class:`daedalus.host.wake_queue.WakeQueue`).

Being the orchestrator is an office, not a property of a session. The project's settings name the one
session that holds it, and only a compare-and-set changes that name; enabling, replacing and
disabling also hold a lock per project. Every tool starts by asking :meth:`Orchestrators.current`,
so a replaced orchestrator whose engine is still running cannot act for the project it left: two
orchestrators can never act at once, and a replacement is never silent — the journal says who
replaced whom and why, and the successor's first state block names its predecessor.

An orchestrator never blocks on the operator. Its questions (``AskOperator``) are request rows that
return at once; the answer arrives as an ``ask.answered`` event in a later wake-up.
