"""Command-line agents: what is installed where, and what each one can do, as ``app.extensions["harness"]``.

The staff lifecycle is the staff extension's; this one holds what is particular to the CLIs
themselves — the harness manager — so the hiring form and the orchestrator ask one place whether a
harness can be chosen, and the Harnesses screen installs, updates and checks them. It also puts one
staff runtime per CLI that has an adapter into the team's ``runtimes``, and takes up the CLIs a
previous host left running.
