"""What a project spends, where the work is: per staff member, its orchestrator and its other sessions.

Two sources, never added together for one session:

- a Daedalus session's calls are in ``usage_events``, priced or not. A session's subagents are counted
  with the session that started them (the way the spend cap counts them), so a staff member who hands
  work to a subagent is charged for it, and the subagent is not counted a second time as "other";
- a command-line member's spend is what its CLI reports, the latest snapshot per session in
  ``staff_sessions.usage_json``: tokens, a price when the CLI is metered, the share of the subscription
  window when it is not. A snapshot is cumulative and carries no time of its own, so a session counts
  in a window when it was last active inside it.

A call the provider did not price is counted as ``unpriced`` rather than as zero dollars, so "$0.00"
never hides spend nobody measured. Everything is read with one indexed query over the project's
sessions (``usage_events_by_session``) and one over its staff sessions.
