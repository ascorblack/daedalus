"""A project's topic in Telegram: the one place there that is the project's, spoken in only by its orchestrator.

When a project's orchestrator is switched on and a forum is bound, it gets a topic under the project's
name. The operator writes there and the orchestrator receives it, through the ordinary topic binding;
the orchestrator's turns do not stream there (its session is quiet, see ``front.is_quiet``) and its
answers stay in the app. What does appear is chosen here, by a bus subscriber, and nothing else posts:

- the orchestrator's reports (``ProjectReport``) and its own notifications (``Notify``);
- every request of the project that waits on the operator — the orchestrator's questions, the folders it
  asks for, the staff requests it escalated or that go to the operator directly — with buttons that
  answer it (first answer wins; a late tap is told who was first) and a way to answer in words.

The notification router never posts these (an orchestrated project's items are routed to the
orchestrator), and staff, subagents and the router are never given the topic, so each item appears once.

Telegram is optional: without a bot nothing here is installed, and everything above lives in the app.
In private mode (no forum) the same posts go to the private chat under the project's name, and the
private chat stays the window onto whatever session the operator is using; a reply to one of these posts
goes to the project's orchestrator (or answers the request it shows), never to that session.

The topic follows the office: replacing the orchestrator re-points it to the successor, switching it off
closes it, renaming the project renames it, and a start reconciles every enabled project. Telegram's
rate limit on opening topics leaves a project without one until the next reconcile or enable.
