"""The Harnesses routes: the command-line agents of each environment, their catalog for the hiring
form, and the buttons — check, install, update, sign in.

Like ``api.py`` this module may import the HTTP framework; the manager behind it may not. Every
operation that takes minutes answers at once and finishes in the background, reporting through the
event bus (``harness.check``, ``harness.updated``); what can refuse (the environment is down, the CLI
is busy, staff are working on it) refuses before anything starts.
