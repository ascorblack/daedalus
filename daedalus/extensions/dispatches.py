"""Dispatches: work the main orchestrator hands to a project, and the reports that close it.

``app.extensions["dispatches"]`` is the one place a dispatch changes. The main orchestrator opens
one (``dispatch.created``) or adds a follow-up (``dispatch.message``); both wake the project's
orchestrator at once. The project's orchestrator answers with ``ProjectReport(dispatch_id=…)``: a
progress report is a message on the dispatch, a done or blocked report closes it
(``dispatch.closed``). Those two — and a stalled dispatch — are the only things that wake the main
orchestrator, and nothing it does wakes itself, so the two cannot keep each other busy.

A dispatch that goes quiet is watched here too: open for ``dispatcher.stalled_minutes`` with nothing
said on it, while nobody in its project works and its orchestrator is not mid-turn, it raises
``dispatch.stalled`` once. The main orchestrator tells the operator; it does not prod the project.

Questions travel with a dispatch without being copied. A request row names the dispatch it belongs to
(``asks.dispatch_id``), and every window shows that same row. While a project is being set up by the
main orchestrator, every request of the project is linked to its first dispatch. A request of the
orchestrator's own is withdrawn when its dispatch closes, since nobody is waiting on its answer.
