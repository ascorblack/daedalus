"""The staff runtime of a command-line agent: one CLI, run as a staff member inside a terminal.

The team decides who works on what, keeps the rows and runs the launch queue; this runs the CLI. For
each staff session it registers a launch with the terminal daemon (the overlay files, the ports, the
hook token), starts the CLI's terminals as an agent's — so a launch at the machine's cap waits for a
place instead of being refused — takes the CLI through its readiness gate, and turns what the CLI
does into the one status machine's transitions. Every change it sees goes to the team's ingress,
which writes the row and publishes the event; nothing here writes a staff table.

Three sources feed a session, all into one serialised ``_apply``: the adapter's ``events`` (the CLI's
hooks or its structured channel, normalised), the daemon's terminal events (the CLI or its companion
exiting), and a quiet timer that reads the screen when a working session has said nothing for a
while. The team tools' posts (``Report``, ``AskOrchestrator``) arrive on the same hook listener and
are answered here, since they mean the same for every CLI.

A restarted host finds its CLIs still running — the daemon owns them — and ``reconcile`` takes each
open launch up again: the adapter re-attaches, the daemon replays the hook posts made meanwhile, and
the status continues from the row.
