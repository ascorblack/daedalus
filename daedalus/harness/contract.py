"""The contract every command-line harness adapter keeps, and the values that cross it.

An adapter knows one CLI: how to launch it inside a terminal, how to tell when it is ready, busy,
asking or done, how to hand it a message and prove it arrived, and where it keeps its transcript.
It knows nothing of staff, projects, queues or the database. The staff runtime for command-line
staff wraps an adapter, feeds its events through the state machine (``state.py``) and reports to the
orchestrator's ingress; the harness manager uses the version, catalog and sign-in half.

The adapter never touches a terminal or an environment directly. It is handed two narrow ports,
``TerminalPort`` for the one terminal it drives and ``EnvironmentPort`` for the environment the CLI
lives in, both implemented over the terminal daemon's connection. That keeps an adapter testable
against a fake daemon, and keeps every write to a terminal on the one audited path.
