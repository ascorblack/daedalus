"""Codex as a staff member: its TUI in a terminal, driven through the app server it talks to.

Measured against Codex 0.155.1 in a throwaway home; what the app server and the TUI said is in
``tests/support/fake_cli/recorded/codex`` and the fake Codex replays it. What matters here:

- **Two processes.** ``codex app-server --listen unix://<dial dir>/codex.sock`` runs as the launch's
  companion terminal, and the TUI attaches to it with ``codex --remote unix://… resume <thread>``.
  The host reaches the same server through the daemon's ``net.dial``: it speaks JSON-RPC over a
  WebSocket on that socket (a bare JSON line is met with a closed connection).
- **The host starts the thread.** Notifications about a thread's turns and items go only to the
  clients subscribed to it — the one that started it and those that resumed it — while every client
  hears ``thread/started`` and status changes. A thread nobody has written to yet cannot be resumed
  ("no rollout found"), neither by the TUI nor by this client, so a TUI-started thread would stay
  mute to the host. So the host starts the thread with the member's developer instructions, writes
  one developer item into it (which creates its rollout), and only then names the thread in a
  launch file; the TUI's terminal waits for that file and then attaches with ``resume``. Every
  prompt the host sends appears in the TUI, and whatever the operator types there reaches the host.
- **Acknowledgement by id.** ``turn/start`` and ``turn/steer`` carry ``clientUserMessageId``, and the
  ``userMessage`` item that follows echoes it as ``clientId``.
- **Steer** is ``turn/steer`` with the running turn's id; a turn that just ended refuses it ("no
  active turn to steer") and the message starts a turn instead.
- **Requests.** Approvals and questions are server requests to the subscribed clients; the answer is
  the JSON-RPC response, and ``serverRequest/resolved`` says one was settled (by whoever answered).
  Which clients receive them could not be measured (the account was at its usage limit, so no model
  turn ran); the host is subscribed from the thread's start, so it receives them whether they go to
  every client or to the thread's first one. When the thread says it waits on an approval and no
  request reached the host, the operator is told to answer in the terminal.
- **Switches.** ``check_for_update_on_startup=false`` is the TUI's own setting (the update prompt
  appeared with it only on the server); the rate-limit model nudge is a dialog too and is switched off
  the same way. The MCP servers Codex starts get a filtered environment, so the team bridge's
  variables are passed through by name; ``default_tools_approval_mode="approve"`` keeps its tools from
  asking, and ``tool_timeout_sec`` is set above the longest hold. The ``daedalus-team`` skill is a
  launch file, added with ``skills/extraRoots/set`` (verified in ``skills/list``).
