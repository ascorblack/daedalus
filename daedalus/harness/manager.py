"""The harness manager: which command-line agents are installed in each environment, at which version
against the newest, signed in or not, with which agents and models; and installing, updating and
checking them, one button per CLI.

It is ``app.extensions["harness"]``, the one place the Harnesses screen, the hiring form, the ``Hire``
check and the orchestrator's ``Harnesses`` tool ask. It never updates on its own: the periodic check
only looks, and a version changes when the operator presses Update — never under a staff member who
is working, because the CLI's files are replaced while it runs.

After every install or update the CLI is checked: its version, that it is a version the adapter
supports, that it is signed in, and — through the adapter's own self-check once the adapter exists —
that a session starts and one tiny prompt on the cheapest model gets an answer. What could not be
run is recorded as skipped, never as passed.
