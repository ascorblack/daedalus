"""What each command-line agent offers, as data: the channels an adapter uses and how far to trust them.

The table is code rather than prose so that three readers agree on it: the adapters, which choose a
channel by it; the delivery pipeline, which decides what "steer" means for a harness by it; and the
app and the orchestrator, which show the operator and the model what a harness can and cannot do
(the Harnesses screen's "status channel" column, the ``Harnesses`` tool). A value that is not yet
proven against the real CLI is marked in its field's comment; the adapter that proves it corrects
it here, in the same change.

such thing, so it waits for the turn to end. ``cancel_and_send``: Enter while busy cancels the turn,
