"""Delivering messages to a command-line staff member: one at a time, only when it can take one,
and never reported further than the CLI itself confirmed.

A message to a CLI is text put into a TUI that a person may be typing into, that may be showing a
dialog, and that may or may not have taken what it was given. So each live session has one worker
that takes its messages in order and, for each:

1. **waits for the window** — the status allows the timing (``after_turn`` waits for the turn to
   end; ``now`` goes into a running turn where the CLI can take one), no request of the session is
   open, and no dialog is on the screen. Nothing is typed while a dialog may be open: an Enter
   there answers the dialog.
2. **hands it over** — through the CLI's structured channel where it has one (the adapter's
   ``send``), or as a paste: the text (or, over the threshold, a one-line pointer to a file in the
   launch directory), a pause that grows with its size, a look at the composer to see the text
   arrived, then Enter.
3. **waits for the acknowledgement** — the CLI saying it took the prompt (a hook naming the prompt,
   a channel echoing the message's id). Without one it looks again: the text still in the composer
   gets another Enter, a few times at most; the text found in the transcript is acknowledged late;
   anything else is reported failed and never sent again blindly — a duplicate instruction is worse
   than a missing one, because nobody notices it.

Every step is a receipt state (``written``, ``submitted``, ``acknowledged``, ``failed``) reported
through the team's ingress, and a fact in ``harness_deliveries``.
