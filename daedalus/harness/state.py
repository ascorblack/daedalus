"""The status of a command-line staff session, decided in one place.

Adapters report what happened (``StaffEvent``); only ``next_state`` decides what that means for the
status the operator and the orchestrator see. It is a pure function so that the whole table can be
tested pair by pair, and so that five adapters cannot drift into five meanings of "done".

Three rules shape the table more than any other:

- A notification that the CLI is idle or wants input never becomes ``question``. Those fire on a
  timer while the prompt sits empty; mapping them to a question is how another orchestrator showed
  hundreds of phantom "needs input" badges.
- Silence is grey, never red. A working session with no signal is checked on screen, and only two
  identical readings of an idle composer infer that the turn ended; anything less certain is
  ``no_signal``.
- A session waiting on a request stays waiting while any request of it is still open, whatever else
  arrives: the operator must not lose the one thing that needs them under a burst of activity.
