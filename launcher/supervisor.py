"""Daedalus supervisor — PID 1 in the container, never edited by the agent.

Responsibilities, and nothing more:

* start the bot and restart it when it dies (with backoff);
* on ``rebuild``: preflight ``origin/main`` on a candidate checkout while the bot keeps
  running, then move both repositories to it and restart; a revision that fails the
  preflight never touches the running bot;
* on ``restart``: apply what the checkout already holds. Where the checkout is the only
  place a change lives (no remote to pull from), the same preflight runs on a detached
  worktree of the commit that is there, and the bot restarts only if it passes;
* on ``rollback``: check out an earlier known-good revision and restart;
* on ``panic``: kill the whole process tree immediately;
* roll back by itself when a revision cannot boot: three short-lived starts inside ten
  minutes put the last known-good commit back;
* enforce the daily spend cap by reading the bot's usage table.

Commands arrive as JSON lines on a unix socket. Standard library only.
