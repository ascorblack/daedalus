# Changelog

Notable changes, newest first. The repository's `main` is the released version.

## 2026-09-10

- **Self-development gates.** `SelfPropose` takes an `execution_path`; a host-module change is refused when nothing
  reaches it, when no passing Verify receipt names the changed code, or when a large change does not say what it
  replaces. The preflight asserts every module is reachable from the entry points.
- **Tool policy.** Built-in rules refuse commands that act on the machine, the operator's paths or checkouts; a
  forced push, deleting a workspace or a host outside the egress allowlist need the operator's approval key
  (`/allow <key>`, the app, or the API). Operator rules (`[policy]`) tighten, never loosen. Operator scripts
  (`[hooks]`) run before and after tools and after runs.
- **Bench.** `daedalus bench <manifest>` runs recorded tasks headless and records verdict, turns, tokens, cost and a
  trajectory per task; `daedalus.bench.harbor:DaedalusAgent` runs the same loop under Harbor against benchmark
  containers. A provider endpoint can pin its sampling temperature.
- **Tools.** `Exec(background=true)` with `JobOutput`/`JobKill`/`JobList`; long output keeps head and tail and is
  spilled to a file; `Edit` matches loosely and shows the closest lines on a miss; `MultiEdit`; a written Python
  file is parsed and linted in the result; `SubAgent` takes `expects`, `deliverable` and `persona`; `Skill` fills
  a recipe's parameters; `SkillDraft` saves a skill distilled from a session.
- **Modes and budgets.** A `plan` mode allows only read-only tools until the operator switches it; runs can be
  capped by active minutes and by tokens; the compaction summariser and memory extraction can run on a cheaper
  preset; `AGENTS.md` and the session's open board tasks ride along in the prompt; the board writes `PLAN.md`.
- **Ops.** The sandbox fails closed; every tool call leaves a timing row and every network host an egress row
  (shown in the app); a session exports as one Markdown file; `deploy/setup.sh` sets a new installation up.
- **Memory.** Recall ranks with BM25 and recency; optional extraction of durable facts after a run.
