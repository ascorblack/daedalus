const usage = `daedalus-desktop — run Daedalus on this machine with Docker

usage: daedalus-desktop [flags] [command]

commands:
  (none)      set up if needed, start the stack and open the app
  setup       ask the setup questions again and rewrite the configuration
  start       start the stack and open the app
  stop        stop the containers (they stay until started again)
  status      what is configured, what is running
  logs [-f]   the stack's logs
  update      move both checkouts to what is published, refresh the images, restart
  open        open the app in the browser
  pair        print a fresh pairing link for signing in to the app
  uninstall   remove the containers, networks and volumes
  install X   native mode only: fetch a runtime extra — "node" for the skills that
              shell out to npx and for rebuilding the app, "browser" for the headless
              Chromium the browser skills drive. Neither is part of a first run.

A daedalus:// link may be given instead of a command — daedalus://open/<session-id> opens that
conversation. A launcher that is already running is brought to the front and handed the link; a
second one never starts.

flags:
  --data DIR  where the checkouts, the keys and the environment live
              (default: ./data, or data/ beside the app when run from Daedalus.app)
  --mode M    docker or native. Docker puts the agent in a container; native runs it on
              this machine out of a portable runtime the launcher downloads — lighter and
              faster, with no container boundary. Asked once on the first run and
              remembered; DAEDALUS_MODE does the same for a shell that sets it up once.
  --port N    the port the launcher's own page listens on (default: 8770)
  --setup     ask the setup questions even though the configuration exists
  --keep-data uninstall: keep the volumes and the data folder
  -f          logs: follow
  --version   print the version and exit
