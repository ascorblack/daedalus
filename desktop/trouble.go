// What went wrong, in the operator's language.
//
// Everything the launcher runs is a program that reports in English and in its own vocabulary: a Go
// error about a DNS lookup, a compose command that could not reach a daemon, a port that is taken.
// On the progress page that text is not decoration beside an explanation — it *is* the explanation,
// on the one screen where somebody is stuck and has to decide what to do next. So the handful of
// failures that actually happen on a first run are recognised here and answered with a sentence
// that says what to do, and the original text is kept on the page behind the disclosure for whoever
// wants it.
//
// A failure nobody recognised keeps the behaviour it had: the raw text, which is a visible gap
// rather than a silent one.

// failureKeys are the sentences, in the order they are tried. Docker comes before the network
// because "cannot connect to the Docker daemon" is a connection failure that has nothing to do with
// the internet, and a disk that is full before anything else because it makes every other symptom.
