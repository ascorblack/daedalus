// Two ways to run Daedalus on this machine, and the launcher drives both.
//
// *Docker* puts the agent in a container: the process the agent's shell commands run in is not the
// operator's, it has its own filesystem and its own network, and a command that goes wrong stops at
// the container's edge. It costs Docker Desktop — an application of its own with a virtual machine
// behind it — and about half a gigabyte of images on top.
//
// *Native* runs the same code as a process on the machine, out of a private folder of downloaded
// binaries. It is smaller, it starts in a second instead of waiting for a VM, and it has no
// container boundary: Exec runs as the operator. The policy engine, the approval gates, the egress
// allowlist and the spend caps are all still there — they are in the agent, not in the container —
// but the wall behind them is gone, and the setup page says so rather than leaving it to be
// discovered.
//
// The choice is made once, on the first run, and written next to the data. A script that wants one
// or the other passes --mode; the environment's DAEDALUS_MODE does the same for a shell that sets
// it up once and runs the launcher many times.
