# Daedalus on your own machine

`daedalus-desktop` is one small program — `Daedalus.app` on macOS — that turns a folder into a
running Daedalus. It fetches the two repositories, asks the handful of questions the installation
needs on a page of its own, writes the environment files, and then runs the agent one of two ways.

**The first run asks which**, and the choice is written next to the data and never asked again
(`--mode docker` / `--mode native`, or `DAEDALUS_MODE`, answers it from a script):

| | Native | Docker |
|---|---|---|
| **What it needs** | nothing | Docker Desktop (macOS, Windows) or Docker Engine with the compose plugin |
| **What runs the agent** | a process under the launcher, out of a private folder of pinned, checksummed binaries | a container from one published image, with its own filesystem and its own network |
| **First run downloads** | **103 MB** measured on Linux x86-64; ~96 MB on macOS (CPython is half the size there), ~148 MB on Windows (MinGit) | **114 MB** to pull the runtime image — 478 MB once unpacked — plus Docker itself, which is a ~600 MB application with a multi-gigabyte VM disk behind it |
| **On disk** | 245 MB of `data/runtime/` (73 MB of it a wheel cache you can delete), 390 MB for the whole installation | 478 MB of image, plus the volumes |
| **Start to app** | 26 s from an empty folder, **4.3 s** warm | the image pull, then seconds; Docker Desktop itself must be up first |
| **Browser skills** | `daedalus-desktop install browser` — ~100 MB into `data/runtime/browsers/` | the `:browser` tag of the same image, +~550 MB, sharing every layer below the last |
| **Isolation** | **no container boundary** — `Exec` runs as you, behind the policy rules ([the isolation, honestly](#the-isolation-honestly)) | a command that goes wrong stops at the container's edge |

Neither is the "real" one. Docker buys a wall; native buys weight and speed, and
[Native mode](#native-mode) says exactly what the wall was doing and what still stands without it.
Nothing is ever installed system-wide either way, and Docker is never installed for you.

On macOS and Windows it opens a window: the system's own web view, which shows the launcher's page
while the stack comes up and the app itself once it answers. On Linux it opens a browser window with
nothing around it — no tabs, no address bar — and falls back to the default browser. [The window](#the-window)
says why the three are not the same.

It is about 8 MB without the window and 10–12 MB with it, twice that as the universal macOS build.
In Docker mode everything that runs is in containers; in native mode the launcher downloads what it
needs into `data/runtime/` and runs it from there.

## Get it

One line on macOS and Linux — it takes the newest `desktop-v*` release, checks the download against
the release's `SHA256SUMS`, and unpacks it into `./Daedalus`:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ascorblack/daedalus/main/desktop/install.sh | sh
```

`DAEDALUS_DIR=/somewhere/else` puts it elsewhere. Or take the archive by hand from the
[releases page](https://github.com/ascorblack/daedalus/releases) (the tags beginning with
`desktop-v`):

| Machine | File | What is in it |
|---|---|---|
| macOS, both kinds | `Daedalus-macOS.zip` | `Daedalus.app` — one universal build for Apple Silicon and Intel, with the window |
| Linux x86-64 | `daedalus-desktop-linux-amd64.tar.gz` | `daedalus-desktop`, already executable; opens a browser window |
| Linux ARM64 | `daedalus-desktop-linux-arm64.tar.gz` | `daedalus-desktop`, already executable; opens a browser window |
| Windows x86-64 | `daedalus-desktop-windows-amd64.zip` | `daedalus-desktop.exe`, with the window |

Unpack it into a folder of its own — the installation is made **inside that folder**, so deleting
the folder deletes the installation.

On **macOS**, double-click `Daedalus`. When the release was built with the signing secrets in place
the app is signed and notarized and simply opens. When it was not, it is signed ad-hoc, and macOS
asks once about a copy that arrived through a browser: right-click the app, choose *Open*, then
*Open* again. A copy fetched by the one-liner above never asks at all — the quarantine attribute
that makes Gatekeeper ask is set by the browser, and `curl` does not set it. Unzip with Finder or
`ditto -x -k`, not with `unzip`: an app bundle carries symlinks and the signature's own extended
attributes, and `unzip` drops both, which leaves an app macOS calls damaged.

On **Windows**, unpack with `Expand-Archive daedalus-desktop-windows-amd64.zip -DestinationPath
Daedalus` in PowerShell and run `daedalus-desktop.exe` from the folder you want the installation to
live in. The executable is not signed, so SmartScreen warns once: *More info → Run anyway*.

## What happens on the first run

1. A page opens and asks **Docker or native**, with what each costs written next to it. A machine
   with a running Docker is offered Docker; a machine without one is offered native, because the
   alternative there is installing a whole application first. In Docker mode the client is then
   looked for in the places the installers put it — a program started from Finder inherits a PATH
   with none of them in it — and without it the launcher says what to install and waits there. In
   native mode nothing is checked, because nothing is expected.
2. The two repositories are fetched into the folder as GitHub tarballs and committed there — with
   `git` running inside the agent's own image in Docker mode, and with the runtime's own git in
   native mode. Each checkout is a real local history with
   no remote — an update is the next commit on top of it.
3. A page opens at `http://127.0.0.1:8770` — in the launcher's own window where there is one — with
   the whole of the setup on it: how it runs, one model provider key, and a daily spending cap that
   already has a figure in it. Telegram is behind a disclosure and stays optional — without it you
   use the app in that window. The page is in English or Russian; the switch is in its corner and
   the choice is remembered.
4. **Docker:** the image is pulled (or built, if there is no published image for your platform),
   the stack comes up, and the same window moves to the app. One image, two containers from it: the
   agent, and the key proxy that holds the provider keys.
   **Native:** the runtime is downloaded and checked, the environment is built from the checkout's
   own lock file, and the launcher starts the supervisor and the key proxy as its own child
   processes. Same two programs, same key file, no container between them and the machine.
5. **The app asks for a model, and that is the last step.** A key is an address; which model runs on
   it — and what it costs — is yours to pick, so the installation ships with none. The app opens on
   *Add a model*: choose the endpoint, choose a model from the list it serves (its context window,
   its modalities and its prices are shown), save. Nothing runs before that, and everything does
   after it. Later ones are added the same way from Settings → Models.

**In Docker mode, closing the launcher does not stop anything**: the containers are
`restart: unless-stopped` and come back with the machine, and the launcher's page is only a remote
control. **In native mode it does stop the agent**, and that is deliberate rather than a setting: a
container is visible in `docker ps` and has a restart policy of its own, while a supervisor started
by the launcher is an ordinary process with nothing above it and no window to say it is there, and
an agent you cannot see is one you cannot stop. A run in flight is not lost — the supervisor gives
the bot 25 seconds to drain, the run is snapshotted, and it picks up where it left off on the next
start.

Starting the launcher a second time against the same folder does not start a second one. It brings
the first to the front, hands it the link it was opened with if it was opened with one, and exits.

## The pages

The launcher serves three pages of its own, on the loopback address and nowhere else.

- **The questions** (`/setup`) — three cards: how it runs, a provider key, a day's spending. What is
  not a question is behind a disclosure: the difference between the two modes, what happens if you
  skip the key, and the four Telegram values. An empty field means *leave what is there alone*, so
  opening this page again to change one value cannot blank the others; emptying one on purpose is
  the tick under it.
- **The wait** (`/progress`) — where a start has got to: the steps of the mode you are in, ticked off
  as they pass, and one line of the launcher's own commentary under them. The bar is indeterminate
  until something knows a size and determinate once it does — the runtime archives are pinned, so
  their sizes are known before the first byte is fetched. A failure becomes one calm card with the
  button that tries again.
- **The status** (`/status`) — what is running, the buttons the command line has, and the log behind
  a summary.

Both languages are complete: every line of every page is in a table in `i18n.go`, and a key in one
language and not the other fails a test rather than leaving an English sentence in a Russian page.
The choice is written to `data/lang` beside `data/mode`, so the next start opens in it. The one thing
not translated is the launcher's own running commentary — the line under the steps and the log — and
it is shown as what it is: the same words that go to the terminal.

Pictures of all three, in both languages, at a window's width and a phone's, are in
`docs/screenshots/launcher-*.png`; `tests/browser/launcher_shots.py` renders them against an
invented installation.

## The folder

Everything the installation owns is in one folder — the one you unpacked into. On macOS the data
sits **beside** the app, not inside it, because the bundle is replaced by the next download:

```
Daedalus/
  Daedalus.app            or daedalus-desktop / daedalus-desktop.exe elsewhere
  data/
    daedalus/               the bot checkout; deploy/compose.yaml runs from here
    protocore-exp/          the core checkout
    daedalus-secrets/
      keyproxy.env          provider keys (0600) — outside every folder the agent can read
      ssh/                  keys and config for hosts the agent may reach; may stay empty
    .env                    what compose interpolates and the agent container reads
    compose.desktop.yaml    the launcher's override: the published image, Telegram made optional
    window.json             where the window was and how big, restored on the next start
    launcher.json           the running launcher's port and token (0600) — how a second launch finds it
    scheme.txt              which executable daedalus:// links are registered to
    browser-profile/        only when the app is shown in a browser window rather than the launcher's own
```

In **native mode** the same folder also holds everything a container would have held. There are no
Docker volumes: the database, the sessions and the workspaces are files here, so backing the
installation up is copying one directory and removing it is deleting one directory.

```
  data/
    mode                    docker or native, written once and read on every start
    runtime/
      uv/uv                 the installer for everything below it
      python/               the CPython uv manages, for this installation only
      venv/                 the environment the agent runs in, built from the checkout's lock file
      bin/rg                what Search uses
      git/                  MinGit — Windows only; elsewhere git is the machine's own
      node/                 an extra, fetched on demand
      browsers/             an extra, fetched on demand
      cache/                uv's wheel cache; safe to delete, and the next sync refills it
      logs/                 the supervisor's and the key proxy's output, rolled by the launcher
      installed/            which version and which hash each tool was unpacked from
    state/                  the database, the sessions, the pairing links, the known-good history
    workspaces/             one per session
```

`data/` is next to the `.app` when the launcher runs from a bundle, and next to the working
directory otherwise — a plain executable run from a terminal makes `./data` where you are, as
before. `--data DIR` overrides both. (Finder starts a bundled program with `/` as its working
directory, which is why the bundle does not follow that rule.)

This is the layout a server install has, which is why the repository's compose file runs against it
unchanged. Provider keys are deliberately not in `.env`: that file is mounted into the agent
container, and the key proxy's file is not.

To move an installation, move the whole folder. To use a fork, set `DAEDALUS_GIT_REMOTE` and
`DAEDALUS_CORE_GIT_REMOTE` before the first run: the image is pulled from the fork owner's namespace
as well, so a fork's code never runs upstream's image. A fork that publishes no image has nothing to
pull, and the first start builds it locally instead. Both remotes must be GitHub repositories — the
checkouts are fetched from `codeload.github.com`, not cloned.

### The launcher runs the Python from the published branch, so releases go core first

The launcher is a binary; the supervisor and the key proxy it starts are `launcher/supervisor.py` and
`deploy/keyproxy/proxy.py` **out of the checkout it fetched**, which is the published branch and not
the tree the launcher was built from. So a launcher built from a branch whose Python has not been
published yet pairs with code that does not have that branch's fixes, and the two disagree silently:
the launcher passes `KEYPROXY_HOST=127.0.0.1` and a proxy that predates that variable binds every
interface anyway.

Release in the order **core → checkout → launcher**: publish the Python to the branch the launcher
fetches first, and cut the `desktop-v*` tag afterwards. Where the two must be able to disagree —
they always can, since the checkout moves on `update` — the Python side is written to fail safe on
its own: the key proxy binds the loopback interface unless something asks it for more, and a base URL
persisted against a container's address is migrated to this machine's on start rather than trusted.

Double-clicked from Finder there is no terminal to read, so the launcher's page opens in the browser
first and everything — the progress, a Docker that is not installed or not started, and the buttons
to try again — is on it. The launcher keeps serving that page whether the start succeeded or not;
closing it leaves the containers running.

## Projects

A project is a folder of your own — a repository, a directory of documents — that you add in the app
(Projects in the rail, the grid icon on the Agents screen). The agents you start in it work in that
folder: every path they *resolve* is checked against the project root and one that leads out of it is
refused — the file tools, the file browser, the preview, the download and the files they send you,
all at the one point that turns a path into a place. `Exec` runs **in** the folder and is bounded by
whatever bounds a command here: the sandbox where one is switched on, and the policy rules where it
is not (see [What the agent may do](../README.md#what-the-agent-may-do)). Several agents share one
project and see the same files. An agent started without a project still gets a scratch directory of
its own, as before.

A session writes five directories into the folder it works in — `inbox/`, `.exec/`, `.jobs/`,
`.services/`, and `.checkpoints/` when snapshots are on. Where the project root is a git checkout
they are added to `.git/info/exclude` when the first agent starts there, so they stay out of your
`git status` and out of a `git add -A`; they are yours to delete whenever you like.

`GET /api/projects` reports, per project, whether its folder is reachable from inside the running
process (`reachable`) and whether it may be written (`writable`).

**In Docker mode a project is also a bind mount, and that is the one place this mode is visibly
heavier than native.** The agent container sees only what is mounted into it, so a folder that is not
mounted is a project whose files are simply not there — which is what `reachable: false` says. The
launcher is what closes that gap: once the stack is up it asks the app which project folders it
cannot see and puts each of them in `data/project-mounts`, one path per line, which it splices into
the agent service's `volumes` in `data/compose.desktop.yaml` every time it writes that file. It then
says so on its page. **It does not restart anything by itself** — a restart takes the agent away from
whatever it is doing — so **Stop** and **Start** are what mount the folder, and until you press them
the project keeps saying it is not mounted.

If the launcher cannot reach the app or cannot write the file, it prints the entry to add by hand,
which is the same entry.

The entry is the folder mapped to **itself** — the same absolute path inside the container as outside:

```yaml
services:
  daedalus:
    volumes:
      - /home/you/work/bakery:/home/you/work/bakery
```

Same path on both sides, because the project stores the path you gave and that one string has to name
the folder from inside the container and from outside it. Read-only (`:ro`) is a supported choice and
is reported back as `writable: false`; the agents of that project can then read it and not change it.
Nothing else about the project lives in compose: the name, the root and the settings are in the
database, and the mount is only how the container comes to see the folder.

In native mode there is no container and nothing to mount: a project is reachable the moment it is
added.

## The window

What shows the app is decided when the launcher starts, by what the machine can actually do, and
never by a setting. Three steps, and none of them is a hard failure:

1. **The launcher's own window** — the operating system's web view: WKWebView on macOS, WebView2 on
   Windows. Nothing is bundled to provide it and nothing is downloaded; the window is about 2–4 MB
   of binary. The title is *Daedalus*, and the size and position it was left at are remembered in
   `data/window.json` and restored on the next start.
2. **A Chromium-family browser in application mode** — `--app=<url>` in Chrome, Edge, Brave or
   Chromium, which is a window with the page in it and no tabs, address bar or bookmarks. It gets a
   profile of its own in `data/browser-profile`, so it is separate from your browsing and keeps its
   own session. The browsers are looked for on `PATH` and in the places their installers put them,
   because a program started from Finder or Explorer inherits a `PATH` with none of them in it.
3. **The default browser** — a tab, which is what the launcher has always done.

**Windows** needs the WebView2 runtime for step 1. Windows 11 has it, and so does any machine whose
Edge is current; the launcher asks the registry before it tries, and quietly takes step 2 when the
answer is no. Microsoft's Evergreen bootstrapper installs it in a minute if you would rather have
the window.

**Linux does not get step 1 at all**, and that is deliberate. `webview_go` links GTK and WebKitGTK at
load time, so a binary built with it does not start on a machine without those libraries — it does
not fall back, and it does not warn; it fails to start. One binary that runs on every Linux is worth
more than a window of our own, so the published Linux builds begin at step 2. If you want the
window on Linux, you have the source: install `libgtk-3-dev` and `libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev` and run
`go build` without `-tags nowebview` — and then that binary needs those libraries wherever it runs.

Whatever is showing it, closing it leaves the stack running.

### The menu bar, and the keyboard

On macOS the launcher installs the ordinary application, Edit and Window menus when it makes its
window. This is not decoration. A Mac application without a menu bar has no Edit menu, and without
an Edit menu ⌘C, ⌘V, ⌘X, ⌘A and ⌘Z do nothing anywhere in it: the key equivalent on a menu item is
what sends `copy:` and the rest down the responder chain, and with no item carrying it the
keystroke is never dispatched. It looks as though the window is eating the shortcuts. It is not:
nothing is delivering them. The menus carry the standard selectors and nothing of our own, and the
web view — which is the first responder — does the work. ⌘Q quits, ⌘W closes, ⌘M minimises.

Windows needs none of it: WebView2 hosts the same edit commands Edge does and handles Ctrl+C,
Ctrl+V, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+A and Ctrl+Z inside the page itself.

### Links

`daedalus://open/<session-id>` opens that conversation, from anywhere the desktop can follow a link.
The launcher registers the scheme once per executable, with no installer and no administrator:

| | How |
|---|---|
| macOS | `CFBundleURLTypes` in the bundle's `Info.plist`, read by Launch Services when it first sees the app |
| Windows | a key under `HKCU\Software\Classes\daedalus`, written on a first start |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/applications/daedalus-desktop.desktop` with `MimeType=x-scheme-handler/daedalus`, which also gives the launcher its name and icon in the desktop's menu |

A link handed to a launcher that is already running goes to that one; it never starts a second.

### Notifications

The launcher watches the stack and tells the desktop when the inbox gains an entry or an agent has
stopped and is waiting for an answer — `osascript` on macOS, a toast through PowerShell on Windows,
`notify-send` on Linux. Nothing is bundled for it; a machine without `notify-send` says so once in
the launcher's log and is not asked again. It is a poll of the app's own status endpoint every 20
seconds, using the token the app minted for itself, which the launcher reads out of the state
database through the container and keeps in memory only. An installation where that token cannot be
read gets no notifications and says so; nothing else changes.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `daedalus-desktop` | set up if needed, start the stack, open the app |
| `daedalus-desktop setup` | ask the questions again and rewrite the configuration |
| `daedalus-desktop status` | what is configured, what is running |
| `daedalus-desktop stop` | stop the containers; they stay down until started again |
| `daedalus-desktop logs -f` | the stack's logs |
| `daedalus-desktop update` | move both checkouts to what is published, refresh the images, restart |
| `daedalus-desktop open` | open the app in the browser |
| `daedalus-desktop pair` | print a fresh pairing link for signing in to the app |
| `daedalus-desktop uninstall [--keep-data]` | remove the containers, networks and volumes (Docker mode; see [Uninstalling](#uninstalling)) |

Flags: `--data DIR` (default `./data`), `--port N` for the launcher's own page (default 8770),
`--setup` to ask the questions again on a start, `--version`.

On the setup page, **a field left empty keeps whatever is already in force** — re-running setup to
change the daily cap does not blank the provider keys, and the public address set by hand in
`data/.env` is never touched. A value is removed only by ticking *remove* beside it.

## Signing in

The first start opens the app through a one-time link the stack writes when it comes up, and the
launcher offers that link once, while it belongs to that start. Afterwards `open` goes to the app
itself, whose login screen takes a passkey, Telegram, or a pairing link. `daedalus-desktop pair`
prints a fresh link whenever a browser needs one — a new machine, a cleared cookie jar, or a session
that has expired. Each link opens once and expires after thirty minutes.

Settings that are not on the setup page — a GitHub token for self-development, a public address for
the app, extra providers and the search APIs — are edited in `data/.env` and
`data/daedalus-secrets/keyproxy.env` afterwards, exactly as on a server. `deploy/env.example` and
`deploy/keyproxy.env.example` in the checkout describe every key.

## Self-development on a desktop install

A desktop install has the two checkouts and usually no GitHub token, so the capability probe resolves
`[self_change] mode` to **`local`**: the agent gets `SelfWorkspace` and `SelfApply` and improves its own
code in the checkout the stack runs from, with no fork, no remote and no pull request. The app marks the
Changes screen `local`.

**How a change reaches you.** The agent works in a worktree, runs the tests through `Verify`, commits, and
calls `SelfApply`. Its commits are fast-forwarded onto the checkout's own branch — a plain local git
history you can read with `git -C data/daedalus log` — and then three places say the same thing:

- the app shows a strip above the screen, *"Changes are ready — restart to apply"*, with the summary and a
  **Restart** button;
- the launcher's status page shows a card with the same line and a **Restart to apply** button;
- `daedalus-desktop status` prints a `changes` line.

Any of the three applies it, and so does the plain thing: **close the app and open it again.** The
checkout is what runs — the image only supplies the environment — so the containers coming back up is the
whole of applying a change.

**What protects you.** The restart is not a leap. The supervisor checks out the agent's commit into a
detached worktree of its own and runs there: `uv sync` (only when `uv.lock` or `pyproject.toml` changed —
the virtualenv lives on the `daedalus-venv` volume and survives), `compileall`, `daedalus check` and the
smoke tests. Only if all of that passes is the running bot stopped. A change that fails is taken back out
of the checkout and the app says so with the reason. A change that passes but cannot stay up — three
starts dying within ten minutes — puts the last known-good commit back on its own and tells you; the
commit is not lost, it is still on the branch the agent made it on. A change to the `Dockerfile` or the
system packages is applied as far as a restart can take it, and says the rest needs
`daedalus-desktop update`.

Give the install a `GITHUB_TOKEN` with Contents and Pull requests on both forks and it
resolves to `server` instead — the full worktree → pull request → approval → rebuild workflow.
Set `mode = "off"` in the configuration and the subsystem is not there at all: no tools, no screen, no
`/api/proposals`, and nothing in the prompt about changing its own code. `daedalus doctor` names the
mode it resolved and what a mode you chose yourself is missing.

## Native mode

The same agent, the same supervisor, the same code — with the operating system where the container
was. What that changes, in both directions.

### What is downloaded, and where

Everything goes into `data/runtime/` and nowhere else. No package manager is run, no PATH is
changed, nothing is installed system-wide. Every version is pinned in `desktop/runtime.go` next to
the SHA-256 the publisher published, and **a download whose hash does not match is not used**: it is
refused by name and the start fails saying so.

| | Version | Download | On disk | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `uv` | 0.12.15 | 19.4 MB (Linux x86-64) | 50 MB | astral-sh/uv release, `sha256.sum` |
| CPython | 3.12 | ~32 MB | 103 MB | python-build-standalone, fetched **by uv**, which checks its own downloads — which is why there is no second hash for it here |
| `rg` | 15.2.0 | 2.3 MB | 5 MB | BurntSushi/ripgrep release, its own `.sha256` |
| `git` | — | — | — | the machine's own, everywhere but Windows |
| MinGit | 2.55.0.5 | 39 MB | ~120 MB | git-for-windows release; **Windows only** |
| the environment | from `uv.lock` | the rest of the 103 MB | 85 MB | PyPI, through uv, against the lock |

**Measured, Linux x86-64, from an empty folder to the app answering: 103 MB over the wire, 26
seconds.** On disk that is 245 MB of `data/runtime/` (73 MB of it uv's wheel cache, deletable at any
time) and 390 MB for the whole installation including both checkouts. A warm start — everything
already downloaded — is **4.3 seconds** from launching the binary to `/app/` answering 200. macOS is
smaller (CPython is about half the size there) and Windows larger by MinGit.

Optional, fetched only when something asks for them — `daedalus-desktop install node` /
`daedalus-desktop install browser`, or the buttons on the launcher's page:

| | Download | What needs it |
|---|---|---|
| Node 24.21.0 | 58 MB (Linux x86-64) | four skills that shell out to `npx`, and rebuilding the Mini App |
| headless Chromium | ~100 MB | the browser skills and `ImageView`'s screenshots |

Against Docker mode that is roughly four times lighter to download, and it does not need Docker
Desktop — a ~600 MB application with a multi-gigabyte VM disk behind it — at all.

### The isolation, honestly

Everything in the agent still applies, because it was never the container doing it: the policy
engine with its ASK and DENY rules, the approval gates, the protected paths, the egress allowlist,
the per-run and per-day spending caps the supervisor enforces from its own environment, and the
public-text gate. `daedalus doctor` prints the same sentence.

What is gone is the wall behind them:

- **`Exec` runs as you.** A command the agent runs has your files and your credentials, and the only
  things between it and them are the rules above. On Linux bubblewrap still confines what a command
  **writes**: `tools.exec.sandbox` **defaults to `workspace`** on a native install where bubblewrap
  actually runs — there is no container here to be the wall instead. It binds the filesystem
  read-only rather than hiding it, so it is a wall against writing and not against reading; what
  refuses the installation's own files is the rule below. Ubuntu 24.04 and Debian 13 forbid
  unprivileged user namespaces out of the box, and `bwrap` is often installed on them anyway by
  flatpak or a desktop; there the probe fails, the default is `off`, and the doctor says which of
  the two it is. On macOS and Windows there is no bubblewrap, and the doctor says so rather than
  reporting it as missing software.
- **Key isolation is weaker, but not gone.** The key proxy is still a separate process, still the
  only one that holds a provider key, still bound to `127.0.0.1` and nothing else, and the key file
  is still `0600` outside every folder the agent works in — the agent process never holds a key. But
  a shell the agent starts runs as the same user, and a file mode protects nothing from a process
  that owns the file. So the rule below names it instead.
- **The ports are the machine's.** `SERVICES_PUBLIC_HOST` is `127.0.0.1` and a service a session
  starts binds there, so nothing is published to the network — but it is the same loopback interface
  every other program of yours can reach. The supervisor's own command channel is a socket file with
  an owner everywhere but Windows, where it has to be a loopback port: there it asks for a secret it
  keeps in `data/state/supervisor.token`, because a port has no owner and a file does.

**Two rules exist only here**, and both are off in Docker mode, where the directories they name are
not in the container at all:

| | |
|---|---|
| **The installation's own files are refused, to read as well as to write** | `data/daedalus-secrets/` (the provider keys), `data/state/daedalus.sqlite` and its journals, `data/state/supervisor.token`, the launcher's executable and the whole of `data/runtime/`. Through `Exec` too — `cat`, `cp`, a redirection, a `tar -C` — because the rule reads the paths in the command, not only the tool that was called. A denial is final: no approval lifts it. |
| **A path in your home folder, outside every project, asks** | Anything under `$HOME` that is not a project root, a session workspace, one of the two checkouts or part of the installation is a question with an approval key. *Allow once* in the app, or `/allow <key>` in the chat, lets that exact call through one time. |

Everything else is where it was: the egress allowlist still escalates a host it does not know, the
spend caps are still the supervisor's and not the agent's to edit, and `GOVERNANCE.md` is still the
one file the agent can read and cannot change. `daedalus doctor` prints the isolation in one line,
and so does the launcher's status page.

If any of that matters more than 500 MB and a second of start-up, use Docker mode. That is the
whole of the trade, and the setup page says it in those terms.

### The supervisor, and the launcher above it

`launcher/supervisor.py` is unchanged and does the same job in both modes: it starts the bot,
restarts it when it dies, preflights a change on a detached copy of itself before letting it run,
and rolls a revision back that cannot boot three times in ten minutes. In Docker mode it is PID 1 of
the container; here it is a child of the launcher, and the launcher does what compose did — rotates
its log, starts it again when it exits, and stops it on quit.

**Apply is therefore two hops, not one.** The launcher asks the supervisor for a restart over its
socket; the supervisor preflights the commit and re-execs the bot only if that passes. Stopping and
starting the process from the launcher would put the change live with nothing having looked at it,
which is why Apply does not do that.

Three small differences inside the supervisor, all of them about the platform rather than the mode:
the command socket is a file in the state directory where there are unix sockets and a loopback port
on Windows where there are not; the zombie reaper reads `/proc` and is therefore Linux-only; and the
owner-restoring `chown` exists because a container runs as root over a host mount, which is not the
case when it is your own process writing your own files.

### Windows

Implemented and cross-compiled, with the path and argument logic under tests of its own, but **not
run on a real Windows machine** — see [what is not yet proven](#what-is-not-yet-proven).
MinGit is unpacked into `data/runtime/git` with no installer and no PATH change. It ships `sh.exe`
(a dash), **not** bash: `Exec` runs `sh -c` there, so a command written with bash arrays or `[[ ]]`
will not run. The supervisor listens on `127.0.0.1:8769` instead of a socket file — which is a port
any process on the machine can reach, where the socket file has an owner; it is the platform's
limitation, not a choice, and it is stated here rather than hidden.

### What is not yet proven

- Everything Windows: the MinGit unpack, `sh -c`, the loopback supervisor, `taskkill` stopping the
  tree. Compiled, unit-tested for the path and argument logic, never run on Windows.
- macOS: the `xcode-select` probe and the folder dialog. Compiled, unit-tested, never run on a Mac.
- The folder picker's dialogs (`osascript`, `FolderBrowserDialog`, `zenity`/`kdialog`) — each needs
  its own desktop.

## Disk

In **native mode** there are no images at all: `data/runtime/` is 245 MB after a first start (73 MB
of it uv's wheel cache, safe to delete at any time) and the whole installation is about 390 MB with
both checkouts in it. `install node` adds 58 MB of download, `install browser` about 100 MB.

In **Docker mode**, one image, and the key proxy is a second container from it:

| Image | Size on disk | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `ghcr.io/ascorblack/daedalus` | 478 MB unpacked (114 MB to pull) | Ubuntu, Python, uv, the environment, the built Mini App. Runs the agent and the key proxy |
| `aiogram/telegram-bot-api` | ~66 MB | the local Bot API server; only with Telegram on |

Budget **about half a gigabyte for the image**, plus the volumes: the database and the agent's
memory are megabytes, but the per-session workspaces grow with what the agent downloads and builds.
`uninstall` without `--keep-data` removes the volumes; images are removed with `docker image prune -a`.

What is not in it, and what it costs to add:

| | Size | How |
|---|---|---|
| the browser skills (Playwright, a headless Chromium, Pillow) | +~550 MB | run the `:browser` tag of the same image; it shares every layer below the last |
| a self-hosted SearXNG | +~382 MB | `--profile search`. Without it `WebSearch` goes to DuckDuckGo directly |
| the rebuilder, for a server that builds its own images | +~237 MB | `--profile selfdev` |

The image is published for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, so Apple Silicon pulls it like
everything else. If a pull fails anyway the launcher builds locally instead — a few minutes the
first time, and everything after it is the same.

## Uninstalling

**Delete the folder.** Everything the installation owns is inside it — the checkouts, the database,
the sessions, the workspaces, the keys, and in native mode the runtime as well — and nothing was put
anywhere else: no package manager was run, no PATH was changed, nothing was installed system-wide.

Three things live outside it, all of them small, all of them optional to clean up:

| | Where | Remove it with |
|---|---|---|
| Docker images and volumes (Docker mode only) | Docker's own storage | `daedalus-desktop uninstall` before deleting the folder — it takes the containers, networks and volumes; then `docker image prune -a` for the images |
| the `daedalus://` link registration | `~/.local/share/applications/daedalus-desktop.desktop` on Linux, `HKCU\Software\Classes\daedalus` on Windows, Launch Services on macOS (which forgets a bundle that is gone) | delete the file or the key; on macOS nothing to do |
| a browser profile, if the app was shown in one | `data/browser-profile/` | inside the folder already |

Your projects are **not** in the folder: a project is a folder of your own that the installation only
ever pointed at, and nothing here deletes one. What an agent wrote inside it stays there — the files
it was asked to make, and the five directories listed under [Projects](#projects) — so a project
folder you are finished with is cleaned up by deleting those, in the folder itself.

## Building it yourself

`./build.sh` cross-compiles all five binaries into `dist/` inside the Go container, so the only
dependency is Docker here as well:

```bash
cd desktop
./build.sh            # GO_IMAGE=golang:1.23 by default; VERSION= to stamp a version
```

Those are `nowebview` builds — the browser fallback, no window. The window is cgo, and cgo is not
cross-compiled: a windowed macOS build is made on macOS and a windowed Windows build on Windows,
which is what the release workflow's matrix of native runners does. To build the windowed launcher
for the machine you are on, `go build -trimpath -o daedalus-desktop .`.

`./package-macos.sh VERSION AMD64 ARM64 OUTPUT_DIR` turns the two macOS binaries into
`Daedalus.app` inside `Daedalus-macOS.zip` — one universal executable made with `lipo`, the
`Info.plist`, an `AppIcon.icns` built from `docs/brand/avatar-bot.png`, a signature, and the zip
made with `ditto -c -k --keepParent`. It needs macOS: `lipo`, `sips`, `iconutil`, `codesign` and
`notarytool` are all Apple's. Without the signing secrets in the environment it signs ad-hoc and
says so, which is also what happens in CI when the secrets are not set.

The module has one dependency outside the standard library — `github.com/webview/webview_go`, the
web view, pinned to a commit because the project publishes no tags. Tests, for both builds:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/src -w /src -e GOFLAGS=-mod=mod -e GOCACHE=/tmp/gocache -e GOMODCACHE=/tmp/gomod golang:1.23 \
  sh -c 'go vet ./... && go test ./... && go vet -tags nowebview ./... && go test -tags nowebview ./...'
```

On Linux both of those are the same build, since the window is not compiled in there; the cgo build
is exercised by the release workflow on macOS and Windows runners.

## Signing releases

A release signed with a Developer ID certificate and notarized by Apple opens with a double-click
and no questions; without the secrets below the same release is signed ad-hoc, which is fine for
anyone installing with the one-liner and one right-click → *Open* for anyone who downloaded it in a
browser. **A missing secret never fails the release** — the workflow signs ad-hoc, says so in the
job log, and says so in the release notes.

Five repository secrets, all five needed before signing is attempted:

| Secret | What it is | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12` | base64 of a **Developer ID Application** certificate exported as `.p12` | Apple Developer account → *Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles* → *Certificates* → **+** → *Developer ID Application*. Upload a CSR made by Keychain Access (*Certificate Assistant → Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority*), download the `.cer`, open it (it lands in the login keychain), then right-click the **private key** under *My Certificates* → *Export* to get the `.p12`. Requires the Apple Developer Program. |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | the password that export asked for | you choose it during the export |
| `APPLE_ID` | the Apple account the app is notarized under | the account that owns the certificate |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | ten characters, e.g. `A1B2C3D4E5` | [developer.apple.com/account](https://developer.apple.com/account) → *Membership details* → *Team ID* |
| `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD` | an **app-specific** password, not the account password | [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com) → *Sign-In and Security* → *App-Specific Passwords* → **+** |

The certificate is put into the secret base64-encoded, because a repository secret holds text:

```bash
base64 -i DeveloperID.p12 | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy    # macOS
base64 -w0 DeveloperID.p12                         # Linux
```

What the workflow then does on the macOS runner: imports the certificate into a temporary keychain
it deletes afterwards, signs the executable and the bundle with `--options runtime --timestamp` and
the (deliberately empty) entitlements in `macos/entitlements.plist` — the hardened runtime is what
notarization requires — submits the zip with `xcrun notarytool submit --wait`, staples the ticket to
the bundle so the first launch needs no network, and zips it again.
