"""The host bridge against the real daemon, run as the host environment is on a server.

A daemon built from ``ptyd/`` serves ``--env host`` with its own home, as the systemd user unit
runs it. Through it: a terminal opened in that home, a project folder checked and made, git run in
it, a staff worktree cut, committed, merged and removed from the container's side; then the daemon
stopped and started again as the unit's restarts do, and what the host says meanwhile.

Needs a built daemon: ``DAEDALUS_INTEGRATION=1 DAEDALUS_PTYD_BIN=<path to ptyd>``.
