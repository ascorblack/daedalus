"""A staff member's question survives every fault between it and its answer, and ends exactly once.

A command-line member asks its orchestrator through the team tools; the question is held open on
the daemon's hook listener and recorded as an ask. Here each thing that can break between the two
breaks while the question waits:

- the terminal daemon dies (and a fresh one takes its place);
- the host restarts;
- the CLI exits in the middle of the call;
- the call is held longer than the CLI waits for it;
- the post is replayed after it was answered;
- the member is resumed, and the old launch's token is used again.

Whatever happens, the ask ends once — answered, or withdrawn with the reason in its resolution and
on the member's status — and never twice, and never silently.
