"""Where an agent is listed, and what the concierge may decide about it.

Three things are pinned here. The Voice project — the installation's own folder, made the first
time the concierge needs one, owning the voice session and the agents it delegates, and refusing to
be removed. The listing the Agents screen is built on: a page of rows and project folders beside
them with counts that are not limited to the page. Every session belongs to one of those projects.
And the two decisions ``Delegate`` gained: which folder a new agent works in, and whose project it
belongs to — with the refusals that keep a hallucinated project id from becoming an agent somewhere
the operator never asked for.

The steering tests at the end are the ones that go through a real engine: no fake ``submit``, a
scripted provider, and the assertion that what the concierge said actually reached the agent's next
model call.
