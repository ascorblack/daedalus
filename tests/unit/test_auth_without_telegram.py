"""An installation with no bot token: it starts, it talks to the operator, it makes sessions.

Telegram used to be a precondition — ``start()`` refused without a token, and a notice with no chat
to go to was simply lost. These tests pin the other shape: the front is absent, the API and the
extensions are there, and a line meant for the chat is recorded as a notification.
