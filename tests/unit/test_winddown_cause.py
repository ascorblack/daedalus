"""A run the model endpoint refused ends as a failure, and says so in the provider's own words.

The incident: a fresh session, one message, and an answer that apologised for running out of
budget. Nothing had run out. The endpoint had rejected every request — ``HTTP 400 … failed to
parse grammar`` — the core's retries were spent, and the run was wound down. The wind-down notice
was the one text used for every bound, so the model was told it had reached its budget; it
believed it, decided it must have done work, and wrote a closing summary of a run that never
started. The operator saw a polite non-answer and no error anywhere.

Three things have to hold, and each is a test here: a run that produced nothing is not wound down
at all, a wind-down the provider caused names the provider rather than a budget, and a real budget
keeps the wording it had.
