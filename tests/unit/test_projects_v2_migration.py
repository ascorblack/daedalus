"""The migration that gives projects folders: an installation as it stood before it, opened after it.

Every project keeps its folder as its first one, every session keeps the directory it works in, and
nothing that was in the database is lost on the way. The seeded shapes are the ones a real
installation has: a chat's own scratch project, a folder the operator pointed at, the Voice project,
a project the operator named, a session with a directory of its own, board tasks with and without the
session that raised them.
