"""The API answers every browser harness in this directory has to agree on.

Each script here invents an installation of its own — a session of three thousand synthetic
messages, a small studio's agents — but none of them reaches a screen at all until a handful of
routes answer sensibly. The app asks whether a model is configured before it draws anything, and
what this installation is allowed to do before it draws the navigation; a stub that answers ``{}``
to those sits on the "Add a model" screen until its selector times out, which is exactly what
happened to ``perf_session.py`` when the onboarding gate landed in the app and only
``screenshots.py`` was taught about it.

So the gates live here, once. A script answers what it has invented and falls back to this table
for the rest, and records every ``/api/`` path it did not recognise so the run can fail with the
list: a gate added to the app cannot be answered by one harness and silently missed by another.

``expect_app`` is here for the same reason one level down: before any of this matters, the address
a harness was pointed at has to be *this* build and not something else that happens to hold the
port. It is checked once, in a sentence, rather than discovered as a selector that never appears.
