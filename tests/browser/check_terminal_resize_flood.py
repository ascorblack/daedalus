"""Resizing the window while a flood is being parsed parses nothing twice.

xterm.js parses output in slices and flushes what is still queued before it resizes; that flush used to
start from chunks it had already parsed, so a resize in the middle of a flood printed them again and
ran their write callbacks again — each one an acknowledgement to the daemon. Here sixteen megabytes of
numbered lines arrive over a real socket (``terminal_flood.py``) while the window changes size every
150 ms, and the daemon's side confirms every size the page sends, so the terminal is resized both by
the page's own fit and by the confirmation. The page runs at a 4x CPU throttle, so xterm.js slices its
parse the way a phone or a loaded machine makes it. Then:

- xterm.js parsed exactly one line feed per line sent (a chunk parsed twice adds its lines again);
- every acknowledgement is at most what was sent, and none goes backwards;
- the scrollback's numbered lines go up by one, with no line twice;
- the last line shown is the last line sent, and the window was never overrun.

    APP_DIST=miniapp/dist python3 tests/browser/check_terminal_resize_flood.py

It serves the build itself (``APP_DIST``, default ``miniapp/dist``) on a free loopback port.
