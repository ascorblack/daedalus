"""The voice page's two halves that only a browser can show: a streamed answer, and barge-in.

What decides whose voice it is lives in `shouldBargeIn` and is covered by the unit tests. What cannot
be checked without a browser is that the callback is wired to a listener at all, that the listener is
running while the page is speaking, and that the interruption reaches the server and the screen. So
the page is driven for real: a fake capture device supplies the microphone, the concierge's stream is
canned so that the page is genuinely speaking, and the recognition endpoint is made to report words in
the middle of it.
