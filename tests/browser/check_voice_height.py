"""The transcript on the voice page fills its box and scrolls inside it.

Opened over a long conversation the chat block used to take its natural height, so the page grew to
whatever six hundred turns came to: the window scrolled, and the floating microphone and the agents
panel — both anchored to the bottom of an area that was now taller than the screen — went off the
bottom of it. A transcript is read by scrolling the transcript, not the page.

So the conversation here is deliberately long, and what is asserted is the shape of the result: the
document does not scroll at all, the transcript's own scroller does, and both controls are inside
the viewport. On a wide window and on a phone, because the two are laid out by different rules.

Exit status is the number of checks that failed.
