"""The app follows the host's event stream: one connection per browser, and the lists move with it.

Everything but the stream is the screenshot stub's installation. The stream itself cannot be a
fulfilled route, because a fulfilled body arrives whole and at once, so the page's request for
``/api/events`` is sent on to a small server here that holds the connection open and writes the
frames this script tells it to, when it tells it to.

What is checked, in order:

- the app opens the stream with its tab id and window kind, so the host can tie presence to it;
- ``session.unread_result`` and ``run.finished`` for a listed agent: the list is read again within
  half a second (not at the next poll) and the row gets its unread dot;
- while the stream is up the agent list is not polled every five seconds;
- the server drops the stream: the reconnect carries ``Last-Event-ID`` equal to the last id sent;
- a ``resync`` reads the lists again;
- a second page in the same browser does not open a stream of its own, and both pages follow the
  events the one stream carries.
