"""Take the launcher's own screenshots over an invented installation.

The three pages the launcher serves — the questions on a first run, the wait while it brings
itself up, and the status afterwards — rendered by the real binary against a data directory made
for the occasion, in both languages and at both ends of the window sizes it has to survive.

Nothing real is in any of them. The data directory is created here and thrown away, the keys in it
are not keys, and every answer the pages poll for is invented in this file and handed to the page
instead of the launcher's own.

    python3 tests/browser/launcher_shots.py

The binary is built in the Go container the way desktop/build.sh builds it, unless LAUNCHER names
one that is already built. OUT is where the pictures land (default docs/screenshots).
