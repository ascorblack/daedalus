"""Does a choice made inside a service's Access sheet register, on a desktop browser?

Reported after the overflow-menu fix, on the same screen: pressing "Local only" in the Access
sheet collapsed the sheet to its title, snapped it onto the service card, and changed nothing.
Same cause, one layer up: the sheet was declared inside the pressable card, so while the mouse
button was down the card's `:active { transform }` made it the containing block of the fixed
sheet and its overflow clipped the body. The release landed outside the radio.

The check drives the real mouse (press, wait, release) on the radio and asserts that the sheet
neither moves nor loses its body while pressed, that the PUT with the new mode is sent, and
that clicking the sheet does not fall through to the card underneath.
