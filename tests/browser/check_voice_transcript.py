"""Reading the transcript without ending the conversation.

The owner's ask was one sentence long: open the transcript of the voice dialogue without interrupting
the voice session, and do the same for an agent. Everything about that is a claim about what does
*not* happen — the answer is not cut off, the recognised words are not lost, the stream is not
reopened, the microphone is not closed — and none of it can be seen in a screenshot.

So the page is driven for real. The concierge's stream is canned so that the page is genuinely
speaking with half a minute of audio in hand, the transcript is opened in the middle of that answer,
and what is asserted afterwards is that the same clip is still playing, that the captions came with
it, and that nothing asked the server for a second stream.

Exit status is the number of checks that failed.
