"""How long after the last token does the session stop looking like it is still writing?

The complaint this answers: the answer finished, and for a couple of seconds — sometimes ten — the
app went on showing a run in progress with a cursor blinking on the last line of it. The host is
the reason there is a gap at all (a finished run still has files to snapshot and other fronts to
tell), but the gap is not supposed to be visible: the turn ends on the model's own full stop, and
the chip flips on the event the host sends the moment the run is over.

The stub here sends what the host sends, which is two events and not one: ``run_settled`` with
``housekeeping: true`` in the same breath as ``message_stop`` — the run is over, the session is idle
and the answer is written — and a second one with ``housekeeping: false`` ``--gap`` seconds later,
when the snapshot of the turn and the handover to the other fronts are done too. A stub that sent
only the last of those measured a gap the shipped code does not have, and never exercised the half
of the protocol that exists to be drawn.

So there are three things timed here and not two: the cursor under the answer, the running chip, and
the quiet "saving" bar that has to stand in the window between the two events. That window is when
an undo waits for the files and a restart is refused, and an app that draws it as fully idle is an
app whose refusals look like malfunctions.

    cd miniapp && npm run build
    mkdir -p /tmp/app-root/app && cp -r dist/* /tmp/app-root/app/
    CHROMIUM=... python3 tests/browser/check_settle.py

Exit 0 when the cursor and the running chip are both gone within 300 ms of the final token, the
saving bar stands in their place through the gap, and it in turn goes within 300 ms of the second
``run_settled``. Non-zero with the measured numbers when any of them lags.
