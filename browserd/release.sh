# Builds the browserd a release carries for one platform:
#
#   browserd/release.sh <goos> <goarch> <output>
#
# browserd is plain Go with no C in it, so every platform is cross-compiled from any machine with the
# Go of go.mod, a Mac's included; only the Mac bundle's signing needs a Mac, and that happens in
# desktop/package-macos.sh.
#
# The version is the same digest of the daemon's sources the image stamps (src-<12 hex>): its own
# module and the shared packages of ptyd it builds against, hashed as deploy/Dockerfile hashes them,
# over the files .dockerignore lets through. A daemon from a release and one from an image of the
# same sources say they are the same.
